2016-01-01,LittleGentlem4n,ems,6,n/a,Alberta has a large fentanyl problem. As a street drug. 
2016-01-02,KickerS12X,opiates,6,n/a,"There is fentanyl dope in northern Indiana right now too. My dude even told me it was 'fentanyl shit' and to be careful. I told him I didn't want it and he ended up getting rid of it quickly. It was straight white, had no taste, and no smell like Travs said. Dude let me do a shot of it for free and I was at least glad that they didn't make it super strong, but it only takes a tiny area that didn't get mixed well to kill people.

**There is fentanyl dope going around in every state in the country, I am sure of this. Just because you don't see your state ever listed on here or stickied, doesn't mean that you are in the clear.**"
2016-01-03,shrekman123,lastimages,15,n/a,It's becoming a big problem everywhere. It's being cut with fentanyl. There has been about 30 overdoses and 6 deaths since xmas eve where I live.
2016-01-03,starpot,science,98,n/a,"One if the highest risks after someone has overdosed and been brought back with naloxone is that they will use again and OD again. When the person comes to, they have lost all the opiates to opiate antagonists, but it's still in their system. So they wake up worse than they were when they fixed, they are so dope sick that they are instantly in withdrawal. 

It's essential that you stay with someone for at least 2 hours to make sure that when the naloxone wears off they don't just OD again from the opiates they already have in their body.  Or that they don't use again. 

In Vancouver, our heroin supply is so tainted by fentanyl right now that many long time users are now the most at risk. We have also had to switch our users who were on methadone to methadose, a 10x concentrate that many users have said does not carry them until the next dose. I've seen so many relapses due to this switch. 

It's my hope that one day I'll be able to carry a naloxone kit at work, I'm a support worker for drug users in the Downtown Eastside. One can only get one by prescription by your doctor if you are an opiate user.  Secondly, I'd like to see Canada adopt a drug approach similar to Portugal, most folks are addicted to opiates because they need pain relief. Whether that's physical pain or emotional pain. I'd like to see heroin medically administered by doctors like they did in the Naomi project. It's getting to the point where chronic users have to risk going to dealers they don't trust not to give them tainted drugs. "

It allows people who can't find the strength to quit to live productive lives without having to worry about how to avoid getting sick. Obviously being off drugs entirely is ideal, but sublingual suboxone maintenance is so clearly better than shooting up heroin and praying that it isn't cut with enough fentanyl to kill you. "
2016-01-03,Lampwick,legaladvice,8,n/a,">Do they work for a place where random bag/locker searches aren't a thing or something?

Probably. Most places, even if they have a policy that says they will do random checks, just don't have the time to spend 20 minutes dumping an employee's purse or locker. Heck, I worked at a hospital that had a drug testing policy, in a position where I had access to everything from fentanyl to adderal, and I was never tested. Nobody was."
2016-01-03,LittleImri,BabyBumps,9,n/a,"tl;dr: Nearly 24 hours of labor ending in a c-section, totally worth it all to have this gorgeous baby in my arms. 

It's almost 6am the day after my Natalia Giselle was born, and I'm up holding her so her daddy can get a few hours of sleep. So I figured I'd write out her birth story! (At least, that's when I started writing it!  I finished it up after we got home, while on watch again so her daddy can rest.)

I had a fairly unicorn pregnancy up until the third trimester, all things considered. I've had type 2 diabetes since 2007 so I was high risk because of that, but it really just meant vigilant checking of my blood sugar and oral meds. I was switched onto insulin when they started going high in the third trimester, but even that wasn't too bad to deal with. 

However, since I'm diabetic, it had always been the plan to induce me at 39 weeks, and at 35 weeks, I was scheduled for a 2am induction on December 29th. I was so uncomfortable by then, as this baby refused to drop and was near constantly kicking my ribs. I walked a bunch on the 27th, hoping to bring about labor on my own, but it caused nothing but very minor contractions that stopped as soon as I stopped walking. 

On the 28th I spent time with my husband getting our last few things ready, and we got to bed stupid early so I wouldn't be super exhausted when it was go time. Ended up only getting an hour and a half of sleep, though, which was unfortunate. At around 1:30am we left the house and headed to the hospital, baby still high in my ribs and no contractions at all. 

We checked into labor and delivery, and I was brought back to a triage room. I was kinda disappointed about this as we'd been scheduled for weeks and the real rooms are much bigger and more comfortable than the triage rooms, but I figured we'd get moved quickly. Ha. 

They started me on a small dose of cytotec right away after checking and seeing I was only 2cm dilated with a ""very thick"" cervix. We were left alone to try to sleep for a few hours while I hopefully progressed. We weren't terribly successful at either. At the second dose I hadn't progressed at all, so we were left alone again. 

Around 8:30am we got the glorious news that we were being moved to our real room. Unfortunately that didn't happen until closer to 10, but we got set up in there and on the third dose of cytotec. We watched Guardians of the Galaxy while we waited, and my OB showed up just around the same time as my parents and in-laws. My doctor checked me and I was at 3cm!  So we started on the pitocin. I discussed pain management with my doc then and she said she'd break my water after I got my epidural, which I was planning to get at 5 cm. After a couple hours of the pitocin I was starting to feel the contractions, so I asked for a dose of fentanyl. That first dose was amazing, I was high as a kite and feeling fine. 

Time passed, we hung out with our parents and tried to relax as we let the pitocin do its magic. Around dinnertime (for everyone else, I hadn't eaten in 24 hours by this point) I was on my second dose of fentanyl and it was wearing off. I hadn't seen my doctor since I'd started on pitocin, but I hadn't progressed at all and was still sitting at 3cm dilated. I tried shifting positions to find a comfortable way to labor without pain meds, but the only position that worked for me stressed out the baby. I still had hopes and dreams of waiting until 5 cm to get the epidural, but my nurse wasn't sure if I was allowed more than two doses of fentanyl and I really wanted to know my doctor's opinion. Turns out, she wasn't planning on coming by until it was time to break my water, after the epidural. My doc did allow one more dose of fentanyl, but by this point (9pm or so) it didn't do much. My pitocin was up to 12 and the pain was awful, so I asked for my epidural even though I hadn't progressed at all. 

So in my childbirth class, the nurse teaching us said that the epidural wouldn't hurt. We'd feel the sting of the lidocaine and that was it. 

Turns out, she's a dirty, dirty liar. 

The feeling of the epidural going into my spine isn't something I'd wish on anyone I even kind of like. That said, the epidural was amazing. I likened it to wearing a pair of warm, fuzzy leggings and I couldn't feel the contractions at all anymore once it kicked in. However at this point my nurse wanted to turn off the pitocin for a little bit because it was stressing out the baby, so I hoped those two things combined would mean less stress for both of us in the next few hours. Hopefully even some progress. 

I got the best sleep in months with that epidural. Even though the nurse was waking me up every hour to shift my position, it was still amazing. Four hours in, though, I still hadn't progressed past 3 cm. And what was worse, the pitocin was stressing out the baby again, with her heart rate dropping after every contraction. The nurse spoke with my doctor and my doctor decided at this point, 23 hours after the induction started, that a c-section would be best. I wasn't upset about it, my doctor has been awesome and I know she wouldn't suggest it unless it was absolutely necessary. I woke up my husband and explained what was going on, and in less than half an hour from the call to my doc, I was wheeling into the OR. 

The meds they gave me made me shake like crazy and I was in a real fog as the procedure started. The drape was way bigger than I had imagined, too. I wasn't particularly scared or worried, so I encouraged my husband to watch the procedure if he wanted. In what seemed like only seconds of lots of pressure and tugging, I heard my little girl cry and started crying even through my drug-induced mental haze. A few minutes later they brought her to me, and even covered in muck with blue hands and feet, she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. She was born at 1:20am on December 30th, 8 lbs 13 oz, and 20"" long. 

We stayed in the hospital until the afternoon of New Years Day, when both my husband and I were really tired of the tiny recovery room and all the people. Breastfeeding has been the biggest challenge, especially since my milk hasn't come in yet, but we're doing our best. I'm having her latch on for ~15 min each side and then we're supplementing with a bit of formula while I pump to encourage my supply. She's lost about 11 oz so far, but hopefully she'll gain it back soon. Part of the trouble we're having is that she really loves sleeping on the boob, so we're having to constantly try to wake her up and adjust her latch because her sucking isn't effective. 

All the pain and stress I went through are totally worth it when I see this snoring, snorting little lady asleep in the crook of my arm.

2016-01-03,Mr_Dugan,science,10,n/a,"Buprenorphine was not an included opioid. The authors included the following opioids: codeine, dihydrocodeine, meperidine, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxymorphone, propoxyphene, methadone, tramadol, and levorphanol.

The authors investigated buprenorphone separately and found that ~7% of the cohort had a prescription for it after the overdose. "
2016-01-03,za4h,DarkNetMarkets,11,n/a,"I had a similar experience once. I always weighed out the same dose on a milligram scale. I'd only do one line on a dope day because of work responsibilities.

I think the bag was cut with fentanyl because most of the lines I did from the bag were weak. Then one line had me instantly fighting the urge to pass out hard. I did everything I could: jumping jacks, standing, etc. but I just couldn't fight it. 

My next plan had been to call an ambulance, but I just collapsed doing jumping jacks. Actually, the exercise probably forced the drug into my brain faster because of increased blood flow, but it was the only thing keeping me awake. 

Luckily I came to hours later. Heroin (the street drug, not diamorphine) is extrememly dangerous because of fent cuts. They just don't mix properly in dope. One hot spot is all it takes to kill you, and you won't see it coming because you will think you got a bag of shitty, cut dope. 

Then, surprise fentanyl hot spot! Now you are barely breathing and holding onto consciousness with everything you got. That was enough to get me to quit."
2016-01-03,SicherheitGehtVor,science,6,n/a,">  And so many people blame greed for money for so much prescriptions.

It is a fine line. There is a trend of massive overmedication in general. IIRC around 25% of all hospitalizations are purely due to side effects and cross interactions in the US.

I have witnessed first hand that sometimes peoples entire stack just consists of meds to fix one side effect while causing another, which needs fixing as well, etc.  

A sensible reduction by a good physician might in fact shrink the amount to 3 meds from 12 for example.

The thing with strong opiates is, they can be prescribed too hesistant or too hasty. They should be a last resort measure due to their drawbacks. If we have a cancer patient, he most likely won't mind if it helps with the pain.

If some granny gets fentanyl against a little back pain on the other hand, it might pretty much be the end of her independent living due to dizzyness, risk of falling, nausea, etc.

2016-01-03,OctaviusG,science,8,n/a,"I am so glad you posted this. My mother has degenerative disc disease and sciatica and is on a fentanyl patch to manage the pain. She regularly nods off and has taken to dropping her lit cigarettes all over her bed and the chair she spends most of her time in. Nobody sees much of her. Her memory and judgement are severely clouded. She can't sleep or eat normally and has gained a lot of weight (possibly due to the other drugs she is on).

It's a tough situation because she believes that the fentanyl is necessary to make life bearable. But the life she is left with is not very dignified. And it's tough to say whether she objectively needs the medication or whether she is just speaking from a place of addiction. I also don't know what the alternative would be. I don't doubt the severity of her pain, but it just seems a shame that opiods (with all their social and medical side effects) are the best solution we have. "
2016-01-03,Eurynom0s,Libertarian,9,n/a,"Cocaine and heroin used to be legal. You could order them from the Sears catalog. There's no historical evidence that this was causing societal problems, not even any yellow journalism trying to fearmonger on the topic. 

Also, meth is probably *the* only ""scary"" drug that would have existed despite the war on drugs. Why would anyone think to create crack if cocaine had been legal? Do you think people WANT to smoke baby powder? 
Crack was created due to the combination of the scarcity and cost of cocaine. Compare to alcoholism, where alcoholics can step down to plastic gallon jugs of cheap vodka if they start having trouble affording their habits. The stuff is vile, but it's still fundamentally vodka, not vodka with a bunch of random shit thrown in. But crack was created because its being illegal prevented it from making sense for anyone to just have ""cheaper no-name"" brands of cocaine. 

Oh yeah, what's the last time you heard about someone intending to buy a bottle of 40% ABV vodka and winding up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning because it was actually 95% ABV everclear and the guy unwittingly drank way too much? People still get into trouble with stuff like not realizing that some beer can be 10% or even 20% ABV, but it's nowhere near the same gravity of consequences as not knowing that your heroin is adulterated with 3x more fentanyl than you're used to.

2016-01-05,aSkepticalHuman,news,15,n/a,"Sorry to hear about your friend. My sister used to *smoke* fentanyl when she was a hardcore heroin user, and one of her friends died of a heroin-alcohol overdose.

One thing that infuriates me about our current system of criminalization is that so many lives could have been saved if people weren't concerned about the legal ramifications of calling an ambulance for a friend who's overdosing, oftentimes because the friends are also using the drugs and don't want to get busted. These aren't bad people that die in this way; they're just addicted to drugs. They didn't want to end up as heroin addicts dying of an overdose.

It's a health problem and ought to be treated that way.

Thank god for the short half life of fentanyl or the fact they didn't test me for that because my urine came back clean. I was out in 4 hours. Second time I woke up to a police man in a bathroom stall. He was super super chill and gave me a warning. He said jail was no place for an addict and gave me a ton of information of methadone and rehab devices and even drove me home. Best police officer ever. I can't say enough about his compassion or understanding. I could have easily had a felony charge but he didn't even search me. We chatted while I sat in the back of his car handcuffed for like 30 minutes. He listened to my story and gave some wise words. After that point I got into rehab and made a go of getting clean. I don't even know his name. I wish I could say something to him.

I am doing well. Better than I have in years, yeah losing my mom was a bummer - but the manner in which she did it, purposefully setting a stage for me, walking out silently sitting in front of me then revealing the gun and shooting herself too quickly for me to say ""what?"" - really frustrated me. There was no note of any kind. Yes she had sent me text messages that day that would illustrate suicidal intent, things like ""Be sure to buy (her dog) Greenies and take him to the vet on tuesday. Okay?"" to which I simply replied ""Sure."" because I had become accustomed to these kinds of texts and had even that day remarked to someone after reading the text ""Oh great another one of these - if there is anything I can be sure of its that after all these years of this shit she is too much of a coward to kill herself"" and I had been right about that every time, for as long as I could remember, so ignoring it was not anything I feel bad about. It was the staging, the walking into the room to sit slowly indian style two feet in front of me, no note of any kind being left, and to mine and the investigators surprise that despite her huge array of opiate pain meds, fentanyl patches, benzodiazepenes and other drugs available to her that might have accounted for her wacky behavior or offered a different manner of suicide she had deliberately taken **none of them for 5 days to ensure her toxicology would be 100% clean**. Something the investigator said was *extremely rare* in suicides, almost always the person was not clear of mind, either working themselves up to the act by taking a drug, or doing it on a whim as the result of reduced inhibitions; not only that, she had enough medication to kill herself painlessly and out of sight ten times over, but she didn't, she deliberately ensured that her toxicology would be clean, but still left no formal note, all adding to my frustration.

Frustrated me to the point possibly that I didn't feel then nor now sadness or longing for her, I don't reminisce about our time together as I expected I would when she died (as I imagined she would off in the future) because she had been young only 18 years older than I, so we almost grew up together, she was my best friend.

But after that, I've not missed her, not missed our friendship, not felt sad or angry or even frustrated anymore about her or that incident. 

Strangely, it seems that she has simply been **removed from my memory entirely** so many of my memories and happy recollections before that had been of her, being my friend that she was - the way I could tell her anything and her I. Now she is just gone. None of those memories crop up, I remember the suicide as it happened but if I had an emotion at the time it seems to have been deleted now. Memories I have where she was a part of the ""cast"" seem to be the same but with her image removed as if by a poor photoshop job, just a ghostly blur representing her role in the memory her words muffled out, her memory replaced by (this sounds odd) but a simple textual context explaining her role in the memory... like a closed caption. 

*Edit note: the uncle I am talking about was not my mothers brother, but my fathers brother - unrelated genetically to my mom*
So I am okay, yeah. Losing my uncle three weeks later was harder because he was just drunk, sad and lonely - and inspired directly by my moms actions - so I hold her accountable for his death. He was never a big part of my life but I have fond memories of him and he has not been ""deleted"" as she has.

The biggest blow was losing my dog, the love of my life three days before my uncle killed himself, everyone loved this dog - especially my uncle who had come to be his friend living with me. I think when the dog died is really what caused my uncles spiral over the next three days, I remember when we buried the dog together he said ""don't worry Beejoo I love you man, I love you buddy, I'll be with you soon""... he was a strange guy, had pickled himself drinking in the years prior but was a sweetheart and funny as hell, the loss of the dog far too young really fucked him up, and he used all the information about how my mom killed herself to do it himself. 

Still I miss my dog the most. I can't help but think my uncle may have poisoned him during an earlier suicide attempt that he failed at killing himself in but succeeded in killing my Beejoo, since he was a maltese merely 6 years old. 

But I am good and getting better, while before their deaths I lived often under a cloud of my own depression, and merely a year before survived a very well planned suicide attempt of my own that I never should have survived, I have found my way out it seems. I am not joyous these days but I am good - I find happiness and pleasure in life that I hadn't felt for 10 years prior to their suicides due to my own depression, so if nothing else all that death at least made me realize I had to make the choice to lift myself out of it and make an attempt at happiness or at least complacency lest I end up like them.

Good and getting better than I've ever been I think.

Thank  you for your concern by the way. Knowing your reply wasn't just a sarcastic jape at what I said makes me feel fuzzy in the tummy. I thank you for that.

In their effort to clean up pill abuse, they made it impossible for people who were already addicted to continue getting their fix. So these people turned to heroin, which is cheaper and stronger. And it's hard to come back from that point. Once they start injecting it it's so hard to stop. Nothing can be said, nothing can be done except to hope they want to make the change. I saw someone here say that a lot of these overdoses are from people mixing things, and I have to disagree. Most of these overdoses are from people shooting up dope that's too strong or dope that's laced with things like fentanyl. It's so scary.

It's crazy to have watched the change up close. It's affected my life in so many ways that you wouldn't expect if you just took a drive through my county.

2016-01-12,Colonel_Green,rage,13,n/a,"Simple: the prohibition on heroin forces users to acquire drugs from illicit sources that provide a product of uncertain and variable quality. The vast majority of heroin ODs do not stem from ""overdoing it"", as you suggest, but rather are the result of heroin that is of a higher purity than anticipated by the users, or that has been laced with cheaper and more potent substitutes such as fentanyl. 

The legalization and regulation of opiates would prevent the vast majority of overdoses. This is made abundantly clear by the success achieved in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin-assisted_treatment) (among other countries) with such an approach. 

Even a situational moratorium on enforcement and the provision of safe injection facilities, which permit users to test their drugs for purity prior to use, has been shown to drastically reduce deaths due to overdose. See: [Vancouver](http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-scientists-are-in-insite-works/). 

While heroin is by no means a 100% safe way to spend your weekend, the lion's share of the dangers faced by addicts are the result of the illicit nature of the drug supply, not anything inherent to the drug. That kid would probably still have a mother if the United States treated heroin addiction as a health problem rather than a law enforcement one.

The only problem is that Fentanyl and its related analogues are MUCH stronger than heroin. Like - a small pile of pure powder the size of your fingernail could kill multiple people - strong.

This causes a huge wave of deaths from unexpecting/UNTESTING users all over the area using this 'spiked' product. Which is no bueno.

2016-01-17,RaoulDuke209,news,30,n/a,"Drug prohibition has created super-addicts. 

Hear me out. 

1.) They made heroin and opium a crime. We have learned this doesn't do much in reducing it's use as laws don't make drugs disappear they just force drug users into shadier business. It's really not that much deterrent when you account for number 2.

2.) They took the opium fields over and have created their own drug market out of it. You can use heroin, as long as, its government approved and physician prescribed. Regulation and control sounds good right? Wrong. This CREATES addiction. Whats worse? It creates addiction in control of hands who don't understand it. People become dependent on their medications and then are cut off completely. This drives people to the streets.

Given the fact that there are major profits to be had on opiates, the government will never let go of their cash crop and therefor addiction will never cease and the demand will never diminish. 

Now lets look at number 3.

3.) Demand creates motivation for supply. What has this done to the market? As with other drugs it has promoted research into analogue substances. Where the demand used to be for medication it has moved to heroin. You don't need to get prescriptions for heroin. But wait theres more, it has sense moved from heroin to analogues of other forms of opiates/oids, fentanyl analogues. They're as cheap as dirt and super potent. 

The prohibition of street drugs and regulation of pharmaceutical drugs has created a market that can thrive no matter what the government says and the worst problem with that? IT'S TREATED CRIMINALLY. 

When you treat something as a crime, you make the value of the substance 10x greater, with higher value comes higher demand and with higher demand comes heightened fear and that's where protection comes in. Now you have people who are willing to kill to not feel sick and people who are willing to kill to not lose their income all holding firearms and being ready to shoot. 

I honestly believe that if we had never went the route of prohibition on drugs that we would be without over 300 different substances on the market. This would mean we could put more focus into the benefits and the treatments for the drugs that were already there. Now we have access to a magnitude of drugs unstoppable and the governments only answer is to lock people up? That's fucking stupid. We need to reform the entire drug policy. Stop treating drug use as a crime and with the money saved on top of the possibility of taxing recreational use, we can finally properly treat addicts. "

In my professional opinion most dental procedures should only be prescribing ibuprofen 400-800mg 4x daily as needed for pain, the major exception being wisdom teeth removal and oral reconstruction surgery/major oral surgery.  When it comes to other types of pain, opioids should NEVER be a first choice, either NSAIDs/acetaminophen for general mild to moderate pain and gabapentin for neurological pain or topical agents when appropriate.  When those do not work, the doctor should slowly go up the ladder to find a more appropriate medication, starting with low dose codeine or tramadol, then going up to hydrocodone and then oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, etc...

I turned him down 10 times cause i had heard the horror stories. At first. Then one day i took one and played music with my band. I couldn't believe I had lived my life 20 years and never had this feeling. I had no stress. I was confident. I was happy. I was getting high with my closest friends for free. It seemed so fucking innocent. Then when we obviously got hooked he started selling them to us cheap. Then when the price moved up for him he started charging us more.

I was doing one a day, bought from him at $25 a pill (which believe it or not was a great deal at the time in rural Kentucky), and I was like 'wow I'm glad i have will power. He is a junkie he doesn't do anything but pills and he is literally going to blow a quarter of a million dollars'.

Luckily we met other people that had connects during that time so all was not lost for those of us that decided to continue down the path. 2-3 of the original 10 that hadn't already quit have now quit at this point cause not all of us were only doing 1 a day and they had willpower. The rest of us decided to keep going with a new connect. But now they were $35, sometimes $40.

It's now 2012. The original group is whittled down to me and my roommate. We are doing at least one a day that entire year, sometimes my friend would do 2-3. Even at one a day, $35/40 is a lot of money. Now we don't feel so good on days we can't find any. Not full on dope sick (as I would come to find out), but not good at all. We're having trouble paying our bills working our factory or serving jobs. 30's have become a fucking chore to find. You're happy to pay $40 some days because you waited 6 hours for anyone to have any thing at all. Some days people don't have pills, but they have heroin. They tell you it's waaaaayyy better and waaaaaayy cheaper. But fuck no we aren't doin heroin. We've seen requiem for a dream. We laugh at the thought of ever doing heroin. Some days we go without pills and end up not feeling great and not sleeping great while several people tell us they can get heroin. No, no, no, we say. We are good white kids from well to do white families. We don't fucking do heroin.

It's now 2013. Pills are fucking ridiculously hard to find. We still make it happen almost every day but FUCK man why are we still doing this we live at our parents houses now cause we blew our money on pills. Why man why do we do this....SNIFF...oh yeah that's right. Everything is beautiful on these pills. Bills and problems and stress don't matter. 

I remember the week it happened. We went through fucking hell trying to get pills. Waited for 12 hours one day. Got sold fake pills the next. Then one day I go to my friends moms house. He has started selling small time to support his habit. This is great for me since I can trust him. Except this day I go over there and he says he doesn't have any pills. Are you fucking kidding me man? What are we gonna do? I'm feeling sick. He says he can get some heroin. It's waaaay better and waaaay cheaper. What? When the fuck did you do heroin?!?! He says last week. And he's been doing it off and on and it's the same high but waaaay better and waaaaaay cheaper. $30 worth will have you so fucked up you can't drive, for 2x as long as a $40 pill that barely gets me high anymore. I think about it for awhile. I've said no probably 50 times to heroin. I'm sick. I have $60 in my pocket. I got nowhere to be. I trust this guy, he's one of my best friends. FUCK IT, LETS DO IT. 

To say it was a memorable experience would be wrong, because i got so fucking high I don't remember it at this point. But there was no turning back. Heroin WAS waaaaaaayyy better and waaaayyy cheaper! And it's everywhere! Soon I have my own dealer. Soon I have 3. Soon I am fucking nodding off every day on $30. Soon I never worry about finding it anymore. Soon I need $50 to even get high, $100 to really nod off. Soon I get sold fake shit. Soon I start pawning my stuff. Soon my non junkie friends hear what I'm doing and stop talking to me. Soon my junkie 'friends' rip me off or get clean and never talk to me again. Soon I start shooting up. Soon I lose my job. Soon my parents find out. Soon I get sold dope with fentanyl in it. Soon I nod off behind the wheel and total my car and nearly die. Soon I'm in another wreck when a friend totals his car and we both nearly die. Soon my pregnant girlfriend gets an abortion and breaks up with me because she cannot stand the thought of raising a child with a junkie. Soon I wake up and it's 2016 and I'm nearly 30 and my life could not be worse. Soon I think about where it all went wrong. Soon I go to rehab 3 times and never get more than 30 days clean. Soon I'll get clean. I'm gonna kick tomorrow, I swear.


Edit: thanks to everyone who read this and reached out with kind words. It means a lot. I do hope I am able to have a future without this shit. It's seriously the worst thing that ive ever been through by a long shot. You don't realize how deep of a hole you're digging until you look up one day and can't even see the sky.

2016-01-18,groundrush,Health,15,n/a,"Chronic pain patient here.  I've been taking opioids for over 10 years due to a botched disc replacement surgery.  Here are my thoughts on it, having seen this thing from nearly every angle:

1.  At its peak, opioids were definitely being overprescribed, even to those of us that truly need them.  I had one doctor giving me a copious amount of OxyContin, and I was a drooling zombie.  I insisted on being taken off of OxyContin and taking only a lower dose of instant-release oxycodone as needed for pain, and the difference was amazing.  
2.  The backlash from the overprescribing epidemic has been BRUTAL!.  I have experienced more uncontrolled pain in the last year due to my doctor at the VA hospital telling me in no uncertain terms that regardless of his own medical opinion, of my long record of taking these meds responsibly, the pencil pushers have tied his hands, and I'm cut off.  
3.  I'm now in the process of engaging in the very practice that is frowned upon:  doctor shopping.  Only instead of going from doctor to doctor trying to rack up even more drugs, I'm only looking to maintain the regimen that has allowed me to live a normal life for the past 10 years.  
4.  I am fully aware that there are other people in my situation who are taking a different, and far more dangerous route.  They are just turning to the street and using heroin, which is increasingly being cut with fentanyl and other agents which make it dangerously potent, and is putting people in the morgue.  

So basically, while I acknowledge the fact that there has been an epidemic of opioid use, I ask the question:  Has it been the best course of action to cut people off like they have, or would it have been better to increase education, encourage all opioid users to keep naloxone handy to be able to counter an overdose, and thus keep people from engaging in riskier behaviors?  "
2016-01-18,Bones_MD,medicine,6,n/a,"Narc scripts are much more common for chronic pain than acute pain in my experience. 

I'll get the patient with sudden severe leg pain who was in an accident a month ago ""Uh, well they gave me 7 days worth of...oxycodone or something like that and I was fine with the physical therapy"" 

Then I'll get the guy who tore a rotator cuff on the job 15 years ago ""Yeah I can only have that F stuff"" who calls me at 3am for 2/10 back pain twice a week. 

The latter is infinitely more common, in my limited and anecdotal experience. And they get the ""He who asks for fentanyl by name gets Tylenol"" treatment by the better medics that I work with. Then I work with other medics who won't give anyone Zofran until they've already covered the ambulance in puke, but will give 50 mikes fentanyl for a stubbed toe. "

2016-01-19,downloadacar,medicine,9,n/a,"Perhaps his objection is because 'nursing leadership' in many places also takes baseless claims of patient suffering or 'doctor behavior' and turns them into 'valid concerns' / anti-physician crusades?

Seen it myself, multiple times with colleagues.  My favorite example was when I saw a GI doctor walk into an ICU room, towards the sink to wash his hands.  Nurse asks  him gruffly why he didn't ""foam in"" with the hand sanitizer.  He states he prefers to wash.  The CEO of the entire hospital system (I am not exaggerating) contacted him directly later that day to discuss his inappropriate hand sanitation and disrespectful attitude toward nurses.

Can you imagine if he had insinuated that maybe the narcotic addicted postop patient didn't need another dose of fentanyl to that nurse?  Probably would have been on the street.

Sorry for the rant, just tired of seeing this happen to good doctors.  I am absolutely sure that many nurses have true valid complaints that deserve being addressed.  Thankful to be practicing in an outpatient specialty though."
2016-01-19,Vendor_BBMC,DarkNetMarkets,47,n/a,"Ha ha! Touche!

Everyone gets over their BBMC-phase. Except me!

Seriously though, any old meth can go into pills It would be a waste of pure meth, which is for smoking from glass. I don't know who the US airforce get their meth pilss from right now, but that contract could be worth the pair of us teaming-up!

We are both manufacturers, but at very different ends of the market. I make small amounts (relatively) of something at the chemical limits of purity, so its expensive.

I couldn't do what Quantik does. I keep reading posts from people who think they can. ""How hard can it be? Buy a shitload of Alprazolam and a fucking pill press. voila!"", If that's the case, why aren't you doing it, then?

The things manufacturers have in common is forward-planning, and the drive to solve problems. You smoke cannabis because somebody planted seeds 5 months ago, and created an environment which was secure and provided all the growing plant's needs, then after switching to 12/12 they resisted the impulse to  harvest early.

Quantik will have encountered a thousand problems before making his first bar. then another thousand to expand his business. If he's anything like BBMC, he's more or less a user cooperative, with some roles being done by customers who he will never speak to directly or meet. But whatever the process, Quantik worked it out by doing it himself a thousand times before delegating it.

I couldn't make millions of anything. the only thing most of us do a million times is breathe in and out. Now, imagine having to SELL every breath you've ever taken, for bitcoin, around the world.

You'd think that would be valued by drug users, whatever their drug of choice. They don't. What we need is a **rule 17 banning ""druggism"".**

Next time you're tempted to use the word ""bartard"" or ""meth-head"" in a sentence, try the same sentence with ""nigger"" or ""jew"" there instead. Read it back to yourself a couple of times.

Would you use that?

I've even seen mods dismissing ""bartards"" like they're not human, simply because they don't smoke cannabis, with occasional LSD and MDMA like they do.

You can draw the line at coffee, or tobacco, or whiskey. I don't consider cannabis a drug, I think that's why stoners can be as dismissive and judgemental of drug users as a whiskey-drinking republican senator - they're barely drug users. so if they want to be accepted in this community, they've gotta respect rule 17.

The same goes for the moderators and their attitude to manufacturers. Not only would it be boring here without Quantik, TGUK and myself, but there would be no drugs to ease the boredom. nothing for ""vendors"" to arbitrage between countries or marketplaces. Nothing for scammers to entice you in with.

Yesterday, I saw a post giving details of some recent QUSA arrests, and a MODERATOR thinking out aloud about banning ""bartard"" posts! If you use drugs, you aught to know what side of the fence you are on. Its serious when people start getting arrested, so when it hits the fan you either get behind Quantik and help or keep your fucking stupid comments to yourself, because wishing harm on somebody who makes or uses drugs is worse than being a grass in my book.

You say your ""main concern is the safety and security of this community"" when you ban the man who has safely manufactured more fentanyl-free xanax then anyone on the face of the planet. But our legitimacy on reddit is ultimately rooted in real-life, tangible drugs.
When Quantik is banned by somebody yet to manufacture a single fent-free bar, people discuss him even more, only they have to guess what he's thinking. You're not cutting the drug maker off from this sub:- You cut the sub off from the world of drugs and darknetmarketplaces.

You weren't expecting THIS particular meth-rant today, were you? That's because you're a bunch of fucking stoners.

There are two choices. We can have them doing it desperately on the street with whatever needles and shit they can get, with heroin that could be cut with fentanyl or god knows what. Or we can keep them closer to the medical help they need, and have the lifeline of addiction treatment closer, with the ability to know they're not going to overdose on cut heroin, with dirty needles that spread horrible diseases.

2016-01-22,TheRandomGuy94,ems,12,n/a,"It's been tough for me to compare. Here are some things I have noticed:
US Paramedics:

* In certain states, have a larger scope of practice (for example, I can insert urinary catheters, chest tubes, escharotomies, intubate) than others, and from what I've read, some of the invasive procedures such as chest tubes are rare for UK Paramedics.
* Nationally, we are less respected by other healthcare providers. We are a new profession with little national representation. We're seen as technicians and not clinicians (for the most part).
* EMS agencies vary from the national, state, and local level. What I can do in my city is different then the one next to me. What I can do in my state is different than what can be done in others.
* Everything we do is because we're afraid of being sued. Instead of evidence based medicine, we're doing things because that's how we've always done them.
* We work under the Medical Director's license, so our clinical judgement is frowned upon (where I work) and instead we're to follow cookie cutter algorithms that **EVERY** patient fits, *(HA)* or we risk the Medical Director's license. 
* With the exception of aspirin, nitroglycerin, and captopril, all meds are liquid solutions. There's no other PO medications (at least at the agencies I've worked at).
* Pain management has two levels, non-existent or morphine/dilaudid/fentanyl. No tylenol or codeine. In some places pain management is taboo (As I hear people say: ""No one has ever died from pain"").

Here are the main differences I see between the US and UK(If I'm wrong, please do say so):

* You are seen as a registered clinician with clear standards, educational models, and licensing procedures. As such your clinical judgement does come into play in deciding how to treat the patient in their best interests.
* Your clinical guidance isn't solely there to keep you from being sued. 
* You follow evidence based medicine with clear treatment guidelines.
* With EMS in the UK being a public service, there isn't the greed that is associated with for-profit EMS services. While some services such as the London Ambulance Service are lacking, for the most part you have a very safety oriented profession. 

* Services have physician staffing that will respond to emergency calls for service. In the United States, that is very rare.

* You have a higher education. I went to a university for 2 years to receive a degree in Paramedic Technology. 1 year of that was didactic and the other half clinical rotations and field experience. From what I've seen (atleast in my state), my program was very out of the norm and the usual Paramedic program is a year long. 


* The fire service is a completely separate entity, whereas where I work (and all over the US), you have to be a firefighter to get a good paramedic job, or vice versa. I am solely a firefighter only because I have to be. I don't ride the fire engines, however will occasionally ride on the ladder trucks (I like the technical rescue side of things). Spraying water on fire isn't really my cup of tea (personally, I find it boring. I enjoy the challenge of using your knowledge of anatomy, physiology, disease processes, ethics, and socioeconomics to treat a patient to the best of your ability)


Thank you for the question. It was a tough one and it got me thinking. I am unsure if I will practice as a Paramedic or obtain it just to see if it's possible. 
Any more questions just ask!

EDIT: Also, it appears as though you are much more likely to refer a patient to their GP rather than transport every single patient to hospital, even when it's not necessary, whereas in the United States we're supposed to do everything in our power to convince a patient to go."
2016-01-23,BaronVonBardvaark,AskReddit,7,n/a,"Probably a little late to the party here, but I have 2 incidents out of countless that have really stuck with me. 

The first is the family who came to say 'goodbye' to their grandmother who had complete renal failure and was on the countdown - who decided stealing her comfort measure Fentanyl for personal use was a good idea - because yeah, fuck granny - getting high is more important..

2nd is a similar story of the family member who stole grandfathers rocuronium to shoot up in the public bathroom not realising it was a paralytic (security guards found him several hours later) I can't imagine the terror he must of felt and despite the initial 'serves you right' thought, it just left me feeling so utterly sad for this human being.

A third just for slightly different context would probably be the first arrest I ever attended. An elderly gentleman who'd come in with AF - had several diagnostic procedures and was looking forward to getting home after we'd kept him in for weekend supervision on monitor. Complained of breathlessness and a tight feeling across his chest so there were several people in the room at the time getting ready for a potential crash. He was pallid and sweating and I was leaning over him talking and reassuring etc - he was looking at me straight in the eyes as he left - I was still talking to him and giving the trapezius squeeze as the reg on the other side began compressions and the crash cart was being ravaged. I still remember him squeezing my hand as his eyes just glazed over - he was gone in that moment despite us working on him for the next 1/2 hour. I held it in til I got home that evening and just cried in bed for hours. Not sure if it so much fits the 'creepy' category, but even a decade down the track I'll never forget that mans face or the feel of his dry papery skin as he held onto my hand."
2016-01-23,dip-my-nuts-in-sauce,ireland,7,n/a,"Its depressing seeing how uninformed and backwards people are in this thread. All drugs should be decriminalised for personal use. Weed, cocaine, MDMA, LSD, mushrooms and many other tried and tested drugs should be sold to people over the age of 18. Each would come with instructions on dosage, what not to do and other useful information. This would all but eliminate all the shitty drugs that people get their hands on such as the NBOMe series, PMA and Fentanyl. 

""Oh but those drugs you have listed are bad and you will die!""
 
People take these drugs every weekend in Ireland and across the world. The problems arise when they are contaminated or being missold. Like NBOMes being sold as LSD.

Cocaine is safe with the correct dosage and in moderation. Take too much and you die. Keep taking it regularly and you get dependant. No different than alcohol! Instead of funding huge international drug gangs and poisoning people with the common cocain cuts, lets take the tax generated and poor it into education, rehabilitation and other positive things. If you disagree with this then your answer is just to continue just to tell people not to take cocaine and the cycle continues. Same goes for every other drug. 

The opiates are a different story. People from low income backgrounds are most likely to be dependant. The party scene is completely separated from the street opiate/benzo scene. Im not saying opiates should be sold at all. "

2016-01-24,cnthinkoname,ems,6,n/a,"My best advice would be to listen to the radio in your downtime to hear how others call in. All of the hospitals in my area are fairly busy and want you to keep the call short and sweet, although this differs depending on location. My call in is something like this:

* ____ ED, ____ ED, EMS ____. (Wait for response)
* EMS ____ is __ minutes out with a ___ year old (gender) complaining of (Chief complaint). 
* Pertinent exam findings and negatives (ex. degloved right hand)
* Pertinent vitals (ex. GCS 15, no LOC, Vitals stable)
* Interventions (IV established, 50mcg fentanyl given)
* Any questions? 

For a hospital report I'm more detailed. Tell them your SAMPLE/OPQRST, anything relevant on scene (mechanism, how you found them, etc.), pertinent exam findings, interventions performed, last set of vitals and any relevant trends.

2016-01-25,ghost_radio,ChronicPain,13,n/a,"I find it disappointing that the article failed to actually address the issue from the side of chronic pain patients and instead just implied that we are all acting out as a mass of junkies who don't want our fix taken away. 

I don't pretend to speak for the lot of us, but I know that for myself, if there was an actual option to treat my pain outside of opiates, I'd jump on it in a heartbeat. But there isn't. 
> 
> Pohl said studies have shown that people using opioids over the long term do not see an improvement in function or ability to live their lives.

Really? Because if I remember correctly, I was bedridden and unable to hold down ANY kind of job a year ago. After being prescribed a fentanyl patch, I am now able to hold down a full time job that is very work-intensive. I cook, I clean, I work, I have a relationship and a social life. To me these things are hard-won victories that I earned. 

To imply that I'm simply ""misguided"" is insulting to the years of research and intense pain I've endured to get to this point. "

2016-01-27,bringmethesampo,Documentaries,100,n/a,"Oncology nurse here - 32 minutes in and shaking my head. He's presenting superficial reasoning for a deep, multilayered problem. 

Layer 1: A for-profit health care system that demands a physician to specialize and treat illness through a microscope, not allowing time for patient teaching about anything - especially pain and pain management. 

Layer 2: Oxycontin was marketed to physicians as ""less addictive"", therefore it was thought of as a godsend. Physicians prescribed - and prescribed a lot. Some physicians were f``cking unethical bastards and knew what they were doing and took the money anyway. 

Layer 3: Americans, in spite of all of the bravado, have little tolerance for pain. If it hurts, it must NOT hurt and at all costs. These patients can then ""rate"" physicians poorly if they experience pain because it's a for-profit system. Yay capitalism!

Layer 4: Lack of knowledge about basic human biology. People have no idea how their body works. Think of your nerves like the electrical wiring of your house. Now imagine all of those well insulated wires stuck together and able to talk to one another - that's the nervous system. Drugs cannot easily pass through the insulation, but opiates can. Opiates are our only tool at the moment for even touching nerve pain. 

My own personal layer: The number of cancer patients that I have to convince to use opiate medication. Opiates are a *miracle  drug* and it is getting too damned difficult for me to convince patients to use them. If everyone who has ever had major surgery turned into an addict, it would be like Lord of the Flies out there. Proper pain management for physical pain (not emotional pain) is essential to recovery and eventual discontinuation of medication.....unless your patient believes that any kind of pain is unacceptable...and the circle continues....

**EDIT:** Wow - I didn't know there were so many biology majors in the house! My analogy, whether you think it's shitty or not, works in the medical setting where I have to explain things at a 5th grade level. Try talking to your typical 20 year old (or 58 year old or 76 year old) about opiate receptors, myelin sheaths and action potentials and watch their eyes glaze over. If i need to explain to a patient why they need to take senna while they're wearing a fentanyl patch, I don't get into the fun fact that a huge chunk of opiate receptors are actually found in the GI tract, but that opiates make intestines sluggish and we want to avoid constipation. 

Some of you are just rude. "
2016-01-27,gerradp,sadcringe,88,n/a,"When I was first getting into Oxycontin deeply, my buddy and I went doctor shopping in Chicago. I had some luck at several spots, but I was very greedy. We went to a clinic that had denied us and paid the front desk girl $200 for four prescription blanks and the hours she would be answering the phones (to verify scripts) and then I wrote those fuckers out by hand.

My handwriting is fucking terrible, but not in the way a doctor's is or like in the picture. Its more like a guy writing a comic book, but really shitty. We went and cashed all four of those fuckers in for 120 forty mg beasts, 480 in all, 240 each.

I said I would sell half of them, but I saved myself a lot of trouble by snorting basically everything I got over the next fifty days. That weekend I had a box of fentanyl patches, tons of Norcos, four bottles of Soma muscle relaxers, 120 klonopin, 120 1mg xanax, and 240 oxy 40s... I don't know what I thought would happen.

I ran out of everything after a while, opiates first, benzos next, and went through opiate and benzo withdrawal at the same time. I had muscle relaxers, but all taking more of those did was make my heart feel like it was soaked in quicksand on top of my two dozen other withdrawal symptoms. I didn't even think I was THAT hooked!

About a year later I shot heroin and cocaine for the first time. I did that all day every day for probably two years. Today, I am four years clean from all that nonsense.

I guess I just wanted to tell that story, I've never told it on here before.

There are even some segments of the Drugs Inc episode called ""Heroin Island"" (About Staten Island) that talk about it.

That being said, I've seen a lot of fentanyl overdoses (significantly more this year than any other opiate) and the vast majority are in opiate naive patients. These people don't get as severe an acute withdrawal syndrome. None have had any significant arrhythmia, and most are discharged right from the ED after a few hours of monitoring.

Then came the sweet, sweet narcotics.  Turns out I can take a truckload of morphine, need fentanyl with dilaudid for break through pain.

Nearly ten years of reconstructive surgeries--42 by my count.

1.  Get off the narcs.  If you you tell the pain management dicks to give you methadone and titrate you off the oxy, Nd do it inpatient if they have to.  Methadone is a fantastic analgesic, non addictive, and actually works for pain.  Then off the methadone and on lyrica, Celebrex, and treat your depression.  If they tell you about gabapentin, tell them you'll shove a bottle of it up their ass, followed by a like-sized bottle of hornets in their ass, every time they push that shit on you.  Same for klonopin, vicodin, roxy, etc.  bottle of hornets.  Methadone and titration to non-narcotics in 90 days.

2.  Man the fuck up and quit feeling sorry for yourself.  You have a wife and kid that still love your dumb ass, and losing you would fucking destroy them.  Sure, they'd eventually get past losing you (but never over it).  You think that LCPL's family wouldn't rather  have him there with them, even if he was a quad amputee who needed someone to wipe his ass and pick his nose?  You bet your ass they would.  You got another fucking chance when you didn't die from the blast, another when you didn't bleed out, another when you didn't die from an infection.  Three damned extra chances and you beat the odds.  Many, many people risked a whole damn lot to get you home safely, don't throw away their sacrifices, and risks, because you need help off the couch.

3.  Life is now different.  It isn't what you had planned for yourself in 2006.  You woke up one day in 2007 and had to come to terms with the fact that things wouldn't be the same as you'd planned, that all your plans for the future were changed.  You mean to tell me  you never failed at anything?  How we push forward when things are hardest shows our character.  It's how we get better, or at the very least, how we get on with it.  

4.  You were a leader--you didn't get that job because you were just the next guy in line.  You missed a tell for an IED.  So Did your buddy.  He died.  You didn't.  Are you responsible for his death, or the assbag who put the IED there in the first place?  You  survived.  Keep surviving.  Earn this, because every day you live is a gift, one your buddy didn't get, and that gift belongs to your family, not you.

5.  You Can beat all of this, or let it beat you.  Your wife is still with you, and that's huge.  Go find a place that teaches dancing.  Tell them about yourself, see if they'll help teach you to dance--agility and strength and balance is what you'll build--then when you're getting to a place where you can dance just a little, bring your wife, and dance with her.  Tell her you love her, and you're going to get better.  Get a dog.  A little, goofy, happy you're alive labrador.  You gotta walk that dog, you gotta exercise that dog... Meaning you gotta move, too.  That dog can be trained as your service dog, too.  Need help standing, transitioning, or even finding your leg?  Your dog can help.  Ever start to lose your balance?  That dog can be right there to lean on or fall on.  Need an anchor to go up or down stairs?  Yep... Can be trained for that too.

I don't have all the answers, or even some of them.  But I have been in 

6.  Rocky Blier lost half a foot in Vietnam, and then played for the steelers, including a superbowl or two.  I re-learned how to write, type, tie my shoes, and do everything I did before I was wounded with a hand I can't feel and  really no truly opposing thumbs.  You have it in you to overcome this.  

None of this is easy.  None of this will happen overnight.  Neither did becoming a Marine.  Neither did becoming a leader.  Neither did getting addicted to oxy.  It won't be an overnight experience getting clean, either.  It is going to suck out loud.  It is going to make you really think about eating some glock.  I tried going cold turkey from fentanyl patches... That sucked, and didn't work.  Titration (reducing dosage until you can just quit without withdrawal) is the best way, IMHO, to kick narcotics.

I'm not you--but I've been where you are.  So have many others who are willing to be your guide, hold your hand, be a champion for you, advocate for you (you ain't advocating shit baked on oxy) or just listen.  You have the tools, you have the support, and you've the rest of your life to get help.

Finally, you know how oxy fucks with your head, makes it hard to concentrate, hard to focus?  Ever consider that choosing suicide (or making any major decision) while taking it is like asking someone to marry you when you haven't jerked off in a while?

2016-02-02,chippersan,opiates,17,n/a,"I def wouldn't say enemies, that right there is the first part of the problem,  you already have the mindset of an ""Us vs. Them"" type thing. 

You have to understand that for most of your patients if not all of them, even the ones that aren't addicts, you hold the stability of their life in your hands more or less. Any decision you make which you may consider as small or a non issue regarding a patient may make a world of difference for their quality of life or ruin their month. 

I'm sure you are well aware of this next thing but i just want to mention it anyway, Not every patient who admits they need their medication in order to not be sick is an ""addict"", anyone who takes opiates on a regular basis will develop a dependance on that medication and need to take i order to not get sick this is simply medical fact. Also anyone who is an Addict is not automatically your Enemy. I don't know why doctors especially pain management doctors who work with addicts and people who are opiate dependent all day long have this frame of mind when it comes to people with addiction. 

You should judge everyone based on their behavior and what they tell you, take people at their word without suspicion or questioning them until they give you a reason not to, don't treat them like garbage or ""the enemy"". Addicts are sick just like any other mental illness or cancer, and addicts who are in pain management and medically need to take opiates for pain relief are in an even worse spot they have to keep their addiction under control and fight those demons in their heads telling them to take a couple extra pills just this once and it'll be alright. I'll put it this way, if you worked in a psychiatrists office and someone with Bipolar disorder came in and was having mood swings, lashing out or generally being unpleasant to the staff, Would they be kicked to the curb for thier behaivor? OR would it just reinforce that they need help now more than ever, When you kick out an addict who is in pain management because they made a mistake and took a few extra pills and ran out early, or smoked pot and they pissed dirty. You kick them out of the clinic and cut off their medication, medication they were physically dependent on, and they are about to get sick VERY SICK, at this stage they are forced to look for a new doctor but in the meantime they either have to buy pills off the street if they can afford it or they buy heroin and hopefully don't overdose on those fentanyl laced bags going around. When you kick somebody out of pain management without any type of warning and without tapering them off their medication or giving them another script until they see another doctor this is the most likely scenario.

I understand the type of pressure that PM clinics are under from the DEA and other watchdogs, but you if you read this, please have some compassion and evaluate each person for who they are. It is probably hard and i'm sure the more patients you see the more complacent and callous you might grow with people esp addicts, But please understand the internal struggle that an addict in Pain Management has to go through each day, or even every 4-6 hours they take their medication. They have to fight their own demons telling them it will be alright to take that extra pill or smoke a joint at night to help them sleep since they don't have enough meds to control their pain because the DEA is putting pressure on their doctor, this is the struggle that every addict in pain management goes through. Addiction is a disease just the same as cancer or schizophrenia, and in 50 or 100 years the medical community will look back on the way addicts are treated today not just in pain management but the entire medical profession, the same way that we today look back on using Heroin as a non addictive treatment for alcoholism in the early 1900s.

I hope you read this all and if you did, Thank you. You now understand a sliver of what addicts, in pain management or not experience each day."

Night of day two burning, painful, oh my god I'm dying, something is wrong.

I recall the doctor coming back with results and said everything looks good.  Tell me what happened over the last few days.  

When I get to quitting cold turkey he looked at me and said oh that..You shouldn't do that.  One of the reasons you feel better now is that we put you back on painkillers.  You need to taper off these meds.  He gave me a plan.

The problem is that my wife or I should have been told this when we were discharged and warned of the dangers.

I remember going back to my doctor for a follow up after I weaned myself off.  All looked well and have asked me how things were going and if I needed more painkillers.

2016-02-03,DNZe,Documentaries,12,n/a,"I knew of four kids who OD'ed on Fentanyl over the course of a year. Fentanyl hit Ottawa (Canada) pretty hard a few years back.  Most people would smoke the patch, but a few would inject it. The biggest problem is Fent isn't distributed evenly on the patch, which doesn't matter if its being absorbed through the skin.  The problem is when you smoke it, you never really new how much of a dose you were getting.  

Most of the people I knew who were smoking Fent started because its a less stigmatized than injection. If you wanted to feel great, but were scared to inject, smoking Fenanyl is a easier, low entry way of using an opiate. 

While I don't think anyone can use opiate drugs recreationally, I really think we need to decriminalize these drugs and educate people what drug/alcohol addiction looks like and how easily it can start. 

People will freak out and crack down on Fent. Next year there is a different opiate that no one has heard off, and carries none of the scary stories. The problem isn't what drug is being used, but how we are able to talk about drug usage. Drug/alcohol/opiate/Addiction is nothing new, we just find new easier ways of getting them. Lets not focus on the vice, but the issues why people are drawn to them."

You can't just not treat someone's pain because of fear of opiate addiction. There are multiple posts in this thread about people using Fentanyl appropriately to treat severe chronic pain. The emergence of satisfaction score based reimbursements for prescribers adds an additional issue - if your patients aren't getting their opiates, your satisfaction scores fall, your reimbursements fall, and your practice goes under.

This is one of the many reasons I am glad I practice a specialty in which I don't write prescriptions for patients."

Of course, in health care, we use medications at the correct doses for the patients we administer them to.

However, there is a recent upswing in opiate overdoses in regular-using heroin addicts... those who use and know how much they usually need to get high-- this is being attributed to their usual heroin being cut with some synthetic Fentanyl in unknown (unmeasured) quantities-- so even the 'pros' are getting in trouble with this.  As an ER nurse for >30yrs, I'm seeing 6-8 overdoses *a shift* vs. 1-2 *a month* prior to the last few months.

2016-02-03,wiloghby,Documentaries,11,n/a,"It's 50 times more potent.  It is not 50 times more efficacious or ""stronger"" in effect.  There is a big difference.

Fentanyl doses are very small (1/50th) vs heroin doses.  But its effects are basically the same.

For surgery, Fentanyl's short half-life and high potency make it fantastic for controlling pain when you have a lot of other medications on board.  There isn't an OR I've been in that doesn't have vials of it ready to go at the anesthesiologist's discretion.

The fact of the matter is that heroin junkies get EXCITED when there is a batch of dope on the street that is so strong that people OD.  The ""Serial Killers"" are the assholes who cut their heroin with it knowing full well that the dose will end up dangerously potent so they can sell a few more bags of that ""super strong stuff that made those junkies OD""."

I answered the phone angrily and heard a quiet female voice on the other end saying something I didn't quite understand through the fog and confusion of still being half-asleep ... something about a hospital and they wanted me to come in.  
  
She repeated herself and then I knew what was going on.  The first thought in my head was, ""...well, this is it then.  It's over.""

After a few years of knowing exactly how this was all going to end, I finally got that fateful call.  The hospital had a kidney for me and it was coming from a young 28 year old male who overdosed on a heroin/fentanyl cocktail.  The realization that today was the day cleared the cobwebs out of my head immediately and I pressed them for answers.  Would this affect the kidney at all?  What risks are there? None.  Except for a remote 1 in 10,000 chance of something being overlooked, I was a near perfect match.  I told the nurse I would call her right back with my answer... but I already knew what I was going to do.  I just needed a couple of moments to make a few phone calls and let some people know what was going on.

Almost 6 months later, and after some pretty serious complications, I can thank the guy that OD'ed for giving me another opportunity at a semi-normal life.  No more dialysis.  No more bullshit diets.    

The option to meet the family of the deceased is out there - maybe one of these days I'll follow through with it and let them know the death of their son was not in vain.  Maybe let them grieve privately for a time before I get myself back to work and regain some normalcy myself.

2016-02-04,omega5419,SandersForPresident,8,n/a,"I'm sort of sad you think ""junkies"" don't deserve to live, but not gonna try to convince you on that point.

It's funny you mention meth and heroin, they are excellent examples of drugs which (1) have medicinal value, and (2) the use of which is mostly problematic due to prohibition. They are, of course, addictive (just like alcohol and caffeine) and methamphetamine is neurotoxic in high doses (like alcohol). Both are used recreationally (like alcohol and caffeine) and both are used discretely by working people due to their positive effects on creativity and ability to get through the day (like alcohol and caffeine).

Most heroin deaths are caused by overdose, which is preventable using a drug called Narcan. In many places, Narcan is a controlled substance and/or is not carried in ambulances, because offering the effective cure to a human being who is dying would somehow be promoting drug use. Most heroin overdoses are due to lack of regulation, causing users to get the dangerous substitute Fentanyl or to misjudge their dosage.

Methamphetamine is a prescription drug given to children (marketed as Desoxyn). The average meth user, contrary to popular belief, is (to paraphrase an article I would find except I'm mobile) either a truck driver getting through a shift, or a Midwestern single mom working double shifts who literally can't both sleep enough and see her children. Breaking Bad and the image of the ""meth head"" have poisoned public perception of a relatively benign substance which, if it were regulated and taken at Desoxyn-level doses, would likely have a lot of benefits. I have taken Desoxyn twice and it really was much more useful than recreational (and I'm not addicted to it, clearly).

The majority of ""junkies"" (huge air quotes) are not caused by drugs, they either have mental problems or are in abject poverty and they destroy their own bodies with whatever is available. The vast majority are alcoholics (""winos"") or chain smokers too, yet we just tut at them for wasting their money. Somehow when they waste their money on other chemicals, it's a moral wrong that makes them deserve to die for that choice."

I was never a daily user of opiates until I started using oxycontin and experiencing this horrible feeling that I had never felt before, but I soon discovered it was opiate withdrawal or ""dope sick"".


 Oxycontin started getting harder to get my hands on, so I started sourcing my drugs online, which lead me to heroin since I wanted the ""best bang for my buck"" because fending off dope sickness becomes life's #1 priority. I started with sniffing heroin, then eventually to stretch my stash I started injecting it. My tolerance to opiates grew to a point where I could no longer afford it financially, so I then turned to 100% fentanyl powder because it is dirt cheap online.


 I knew that I could easily kill myself with this stuff, but at that point in my life I didn't care. I didn't have a scale, but I would inject about 1/4 of a match-head's size and feel extremely relaxed,euphoric, but also energetic for about 2 hours then slowly I could feel the sickness start to set it again. I just about died when I injected a match-head sized amount and woke up 2 hours later, slouched over in my chair with the syringe still in my arm. I pulled the syringe out in a panic and blood squirted out of my arm with quite a bit of pressure. My arm was also completely numb and I couldn't move my arm in the slightest. The numbness went away after half an hour or so and I started being able to move my arm a little bit not long after, although I never regained full use of that arm for 3-4 weeks.

2016-02-06,redveinsleep,opiates,7,n/a,Also remember Xanax powder is produced dirt cheap in China. Oxycodone however is way more difficult to procure. You have to start by extracting thebaine from the opioid poppy. Then you have to synthesize oxycodone from there. Also think about this bars go for $5 a piece and 30's go for $30. That's $2.50 a milligram for a much cheaper and simpler production as opposed to $1 a milligram that requires a complex international enterprise. Bulk prices vary but this gives you a pretty good idea of why it's uncommon. This is why all fake oxycodone pills are pressed with either an RC or fentanyl. It's so much cheaper.

Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course because of the nature of absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.

2016-02-09,leukocytosis,ems,14,n/a,"**Benzos:** They all work the same- they bind GABA channels, which causes Cl- to hyperpolarize neurons. Knowing your doses will make understanding the respective potency of each one second nature. Half-lives are important. The half-lives of diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam are 20-50 hours, 11-22 hours, and 1.5-2.5 hours respectively. Diazepam hangs around for a LONG ass time. Midazolam  is nice because it's so short acting, but it will also cause a greater decrease in BP compared to an equivalent dose of diazepam.

**Opiates:** Demerol isn't commonly used anymore- it's got significant anticholinergic effects, negative inotropic effects, and can precipitate seizures in renal insufficiency. It also causes a lot more euphoria than most opioids (and thus has *really* high abuse potential), so that's yet another reason it's avoided. Again, relative doses are imporant- 10mg of morphine = 100 micrograms of fentanyl = 60-100mg of demerol. Both fentanyl and morphine undergo heavy first pass metabolism by the liver when taken orally- this is why we give fentanyl IV/IM or transdermally (patch). Demerol has higher oral potency, which also makes it easier to abuse.

Morphine is more vasoactive and lasts longer than fentanyl (4-5hrs vs 1-1.5hrs, respectively). You do need to be cautious when using any opiate in patients with closed head injuries- respiratory depression increases pCO2, which decreases cerebral vascular resistance, which increases ICP.

/u/thekerub was right about the pharmacology of morphine when it comes to using it in ACS/MI, however it's worth noting that morphine use in ACS increases mortality.

Luckily, when it comes to selecting drugs for situations you really just need to follow whatever your protocol states. Generally speaking, fentanyl and midazolam are my personal favorites.

Hope that helps a little!

2016-02-09,drackaer,exmormon,8,n/a,"Fentanyl is really potent, it is measured in micrograms as opposed to the more common milligrams.  It is often used in patch form to give an extended release so that you can get the benefits for a couple days per patch (super convenient for round the clock pain management).  However, since there are several days worth per patch, getting it all at once can be risky, especially for someone with a weak heart.  Oxy is harder to use round the clock because it doesn't last long in your system.  Taking a pill every 4-8 hours is a pain in the ass, especially when you are nauseated (a common opiate side effect).  Most doctors will go on a patient/situation basis.

1.  The CDC has no authority to approve marijuana as a painkiller
2.  Marijuana has not conclusively shown efficacy in much of anything, let alone pain.  Marinol (THC, dronabinol) is approved for nausea & vomiting for cancer patients, and is typically used last-line because other things (ondansetron) tend to work better.  It is also approved as an appetite stimulant.
3.  Opioids work pretty damn well.  You are very very unlikely to become addicted to opioids if you are taking them for pain (i.e. not trying to get high).  Remember tolerance, dependency, and addiction are 3 entirely distinct things.
4.  Why don't we just go ahead and legalize marijuana for recreational use?  It's less toxic to the body than alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational drugs.

Edit:  There seems to be a lot of confusion about opioids and addiction.  I think many people are confusing addiction, tolerance, and dependency.

Dependency is when you take so much, that stopping it will result in physical withdrawal. This does not automatically mean you are addicted.

Addiction is more of a psychological phenomenon, where it is your behavioral patterns - you crave the drug, and seek the drug for it's high. People taking opioids purely for pain seldom express these characteristics.

Tolerance is a natural response to many drugs, where you require more for the same relief of pain.

People using opioids properly are very unlikely to become **addicted**, whereby they will seek out the drug and crave it to get high.  They will absolutely become tolerant (I have seen former cancer patients taking up to 24 **mg** of fentanyl per day (the starting dose for an opioid-tolerant person is ~25 **mcg**).  These people are highly dependent and tolerant, but **not addicted**.

But, I like downers that I can function on. Pot and opiates. It started with sippin some hydrocodone cough syrup or taking a hydrocodone tablet. Lit my ass up. Tons of energy, talkative, outgoing...it made me a *better* me. I had a supervisory role in the oilfield and was clearing $140k. Living in New Braunfels in a $200k house and drove a brand new Denali. 

Then, I was taking 5 a day to get what I used to get from 1. Then my dealer introduced me to Opana IR. More powerful than heroin, but in small 5mg doses, it was phenomenal. I'd crush them and snort them and 20 seconds later I was where I wanted to be. Then I needed 5 of those a day. Then I needed cocaine because I had to do so much Opana, I'd start nodding out. 

I got so bad, I went and got a pill grinder and would buy an 8 ball of blow and 50 Opanas and grind it all up and keep it in little glass vials. I'd do a rail in the morning and do bumps all day to maintain. 

Then it was what I could get my hands on. Oxy, Roxy, Opana, Fentanyl etc. Never did try heroin. I was too sketched about the quality and I hate needles. I know, snort/smoke, but I was afraid I'd kill myself. Little did I know I was already tap dancing all over that line. 

Then I met methadone. One dose and you're good for 14 hours. It's dirt cheap and you can go to a clinic with the expressed purpose of getting fucked up and they don't care. It's legal. Well, I've been addicted to methadone for 1.5 years. The withdrawal is worse than heroin because of how its stored in your body and the compounds half life. 

I've tapered for 30mg per day to 8mg per day over the last 3 months. I should be walking away in 53 days according to my taper schedule. Cold turkey = bedridden death sickness for about 2-3 months. 

Even once I step off, I'll be sick for a couple weeks and have ridiculous anxiety and depression for 6 months or so from having a mental and emotional dependence. 

Blah blah blah. It's my own fault. No one else's. I used it to cope with the death of my 5 year old daughter. She was killed by a drunk driver. I still knew what opiates could do. I just thought I was stronger. 

There's a big problem with how this is prescribed. When they reformulated OxyContin so it couldn't be crushed an snorted or injected, there was an 80% reduction in prescriptions. Why is that? This morning, I saw a commercial for opioid induced constipation relief. That is so awful. If you take shitting aides while on long term opiates, your digestive tract will stop working without them. Much like being on a respirator for too long. It causes permanent harm to the digestive system. But, who gives a fuck? Tell them to drink a gallon of water a day? Tell them to eat regularly (many opioid users don't because then your pills have to fight a mountain of food to get absorbed)? No? Why? Oh, that's right. Because the doesn't let pharmaceutical companies profit. That's exactly why. 

Lipitor is straight poison and causes impotence. Turns out, Lipitor is their top selling drug, followed by...Viagra! What a coincidence! 

Right here in my city in Texas, there's a doctor. He owns a ""Pain Management Practice"" where about 95% of his prescriptions are for opioid painkillers. Guess what else he owns? A methadone clinic! Which is for profit, not state run, so he will gladly *increase* your dose of methadone. They no shit offer a week of free methadone for referring a friend. That is so fucked up on so many levels it's hard to fathom. And it's happening everywhere. 

You'd never be able to pick me out on the street. I'm average build, well dressed, nice vehicle etc. So are the doctors and lawyers and engineers and small business owners I see coming to the methadone clinic in new BMWs and Escalades. This problem is way bigger than most people realize and it isn't limited to drugs that get you off. Anti-depressants are going crazy. Bi-polar diagnosis' have risen 5,000% in the last 25 years.

The fact of the matter is that prescription pills in general are vastly overprescribed and it's causing a lot of problems. Opioids are only part of it. 

It's easy to throw rocks. I used to do it, too. But, one day you might just get humbled in this life. Humbled hard. You don't know what tomorrow has for you.

Unlike e.g. UK dentists who more often employ a dedicated dental anesthesiologist who uses a general anesthetic (Nitrous Oxide / Midazolam / Fentanyl) for deep sedation, ketamine is more often used in the US on children and adults who have a phobia of dentists. Unlike other anesthetics, ketamine is a disassociative that also causes hallucinations and amnesia. In Conscious sedation, also known as moderate sedation, a patient can obey a dentist's instructions, though they don't make much sense and will forget the procedure.

It's also great for really uncooperative kids and mentally disabled adults because it can safely be given as an intra-muscular injection which is enough for a short procedure or will provide enough sedation to get an IV started and convert to a different anesthetic plan.

I can't just walk in and get tons of concentrated potassium fluids, let alone ketamine or fentanyl. The only thing that makes me more apt for a successful suicide is knowledge.

- I know that CO2 toxicity is very uncomfortable and panic inducing, but hypoxia is painless and quick (N2 and He for example)

- I know where big arteries are and what kinds of arterial injuries are hard to control.

2016-02-14,tknoob,news,79,n/a,"I'm an ER nurse that works in the Mid Ohio valley, and at least a few times a week we have someone dump and run their loved one who took an overdose of heroin at home and was carried into the vehicle and then brought to the front doors of the ER, cyantoic and not breathing. Overdoses are a regular occurrence here. Some users burn up their veins so badly that I have to put a large needle into their shin bone to give them narcan. Its not fun at all. It seems at least once a week a younger person dies from opiate overdose around here. 

Part of the problem is also that there is an inconsistent supply of drugs to the area, so some users are off for a couple weeks and then go back to using their regular amount, not knowing that their tolerance has dropped from the last time they have used. In addition, some batches are laced with Fentanyl, an even more potent opiate that knocks out their respiratory drive. "
2016-02-14,WVU_CRNA,news,7,n/a,"I'm an Old ICU nurse from Eastern, WV.  Huge issue in our area currently.  Most of the heroin is coming in from Baltimore.  One night we had 3 admissions/deaths related to heroin that had Fentanyl added to it.  Fentanyl is like heroin but much stronger."
2016-02-14,cypher_steak,electronic_cigarette,8,n/a,">“Why is it that the same people if you say, what do you think about sex education for teenagers, or what do you think about giving people access to diet things rather than sugary drinks—they’re all on board. They have no problems with those sorts of things! And you say, and what do you think about the idea of allowing smokers to get the nicotine today that won’t kill them? …And they get really upset about the idea.”

It's simple. Education and harm reduction instead of prohibition. Faith-based sex abstinence programs, or abstinence programs in general, do more harm than good, and state statistics show it compared to the ones that have forward-thinking policies. As in the case of drug policy, open the market for safer products instead of letting people die on marketed ones (like tobacco and/or pharmaceuticals).

Cannabis legalization has severely lowered drunk driving statistics, suicide statistics, prescription drug abuse, and other forms of abuse, either directly or causally. It doesn't really matter if it's directly related or not, though this statement could be taken as a logical fallacy and I'm aware of that, but it's a net positive benefit. Opening the market for market-safe heroin that isn't tainted by fentanyl and other opiates, and clean needles in safe facilities (etc), and enacting similar policies for other illegal substances would create a net positive benefit as well.

""Addicts"" are well aware of the stigma attached to their substances, and don't like the negative effects, and hate the reach-arounds they have to deal with, however safe or unsafe they are. If they could go to a facility and do it there without being harassed and having to hide in an alley, they'd feel safer and less stigmatized. People die on the streets because of tainted drugs, and others assume it's the drug itself since there's no analysis actually accounted and reported to the public eye but if we taxed and regulated everything, it would be an economic boon to society.

tl;dr Drug reform policy, DPA. NORML. State-specific movements. It's all there for a reason. Because the ""public health movement"" today are the teetotalers of the past (admittedly hyperbole, but take this figuratively). Humans will do drugs forever, whether we want to accept it or not."

2016-02-14,Cryptolution,news,12,n/a,"Years ago I got hooked through a pain management program, which ended up in a spiraling addiction to opioids. My doctor went from Norco straight to fentanyl (synthetic opiate much stronger than heroine) when I told her that the Norco was seeming to have no effect. That should show you how corrupt our medical system is. Fortunately I saw the path I was on (death) and got myself straight. Worst withdrawl process I will ever experience and fucked my body for a year after that. I didn't feel happy for maybe 6 months, and took 12 months until my dopamigenic system ""normalized"" and I could start to feel happiness through regular activity. I remember it took me 3 weeks to go outside after the withdrawl. I was so anxious that thinking of going outside sent me into panic attacks I was so fearful of everything.

Here is a [great documentary on fentanyl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04KJBu1XtSg&list=PLZltBRY_fTsftAJhAatz_6RHp1LfW_ePd), which is the REAL cause for overdoses.

Its *not* a heroine problem so much as it is a fentanyl problem. The synthetic opiate is up to 50x stronger than heroine (allegedly, according to the documentary, my past reading taught me it was roughly 3x the strength on the opioid receptor), and when mixed with heroine its causing massive overdoses. Almost all heroine is being imported from mexico or from further south and it is now mixed with fentanyl.

It was not until I watched this docu that I realized I almost lost my life, and that I had overdosed and didn't even know it.

There is only one person who is going to be tough enough on the FDA to actually get shit done to make a impact on this issue, and it is clearly [bernie sanders, who grills the FDA unlike anyone ever before.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1l4nu3HhjE)

Bernie also understands that drug addiction is a health problem, *not* a criminal action. People addicted to opiates need real help, not jail cells.

The only way we are going to make a real impact is by putting people like bernie into power who have shown us the right path towards fixing the problem, unlike the clintons who have always proposed the ""tough on crime"" approach preferring to jail people for petty and nonviolent issues, which results in the majority of minorities being incarcerated.

2016-02-14,baabaablackjeep,ChronicPain,6,n/a,"Hey, fellow chronic pain patient as well as 10+ year veteran pharmacy tech/med school student here! So what I can see online is that this OxyNeo is a Canadian drug, designed to be the ""solution"" to OxyContin (Oxycodone extended release) and its rampant abuse. OxyNeo is also Oxycodone ER, versus the Oxycodone IR (immediate release) you had previously. I have a few questions about your meds:

* You said that you had been on Oxycodone IR 30mg daily on an as-needed basis, then switched to 2-15mg OxyNeo daily -- is that 2 tabs taken at the same time each day, or 1 tab twice daily?

* I also saw in one of your responses that you had been on that same 30mg/daily Oxycodone IR dose for over 2 years, right? Is there any particular reason you chose to switch to the ER? Expecting better/more stable round the clock pain relief?

* With the OxyNeo, is the pain relief adequate at the start, then wears off before 12 hours is up? Or is the pain relief *entirely* less than you had with the immediate release dosing, even just an hour or less after taking the med?


So depending on your answers to those questions, I have a few suggestions for you. General information-wise though: everyone has different reactions in terms of tolerance and metabolism of medications. Metabolism is the rate at which your body filters out and eliminates each dose of the drug. 

Some people metabolize at the average rate expected for that drug, while others' bodies can eliminate the drug at a much faster rate, leaving that person with fewer hours of pain relief than they expect. For me, I metabolize opiates a bit more quickly than others, so my fentanyl transdermal patch prescription is written that I change my patch every 48 hours, versus every 72 hours (which is the normal dosing schedule.) For people like me, accommodations like mine must be made to ensure that pain relief really is constant and steady, not on a roller coaster of ups and downs that give relief sometimes, but leave you crashing and losing function later on. Some people's quick metabolism leads them to find that the hassle of taking the IR tablets more often is preferable to being cut short by the ER medication.

Tolerance is a related, but different function, referring to the process by which your body responds to the fact that it is now metabolizing something on a routine basis, and increasing the number of 'responders' it has to do that job. As time passes and the body increases its stock of the particular enzyme that metabolizes the drug, it's able to respond and eliminate more quickly the dose that previously provided relief. This is when a larger dose becomes necessary to provide adequate relief. The process of tolerance is also different from person to person, and between different drugs. Generally speaking though, over 2 years on the same daily dose of Oxycodone IR is by no means considered a ""fast"" tolerance to the dose - this would have been helped a lot by your irregular/as needed use of the drug, versus the once or twice daily dosing of the ER version. 

Alright, class dismissed :) whenever you can answer my questions above, I'll have more specific info for you! Hope this all is helpful "
2016-02-15,cookie5427,Documentaries,11,n/a,"Fentanyl has a very legitimate role in anaesthesia and acute pain management. It is fast acting, has a short duration of action, is easy to administer and is reversible. It has fewer side effects than some other opioids and is cheap. The reason it is used for chronic pain and acute pain is due to its safety. It is also very lipid soluble so it can be administered transcutaneously, intranasally and transbuccal.
Anyone who works in an acute care environment will attest to its superiority over other opioids.

2016-02-18,Neonatalnerd,BabyBumps,9,n/a,"Arrived yesterday afternoon to have my cervix checked after the foley balloon insertion Tuesday eve. Initially they weren't too hopeful I had progressed, because the balloon was still inside me. When the doc went to check, the balloon was in my canal, and I was 5cm! So out came the foley cath... We grabbed lunch then headed to L&D! 
Please, please remember to eat before you head into the hospital! Also make sure you have snacks ready for your partner, and have your nurse to remind him to eat. Once my labor began, my hubby refused to go down to eat; he wouldn't leave me, and I wasn't allowed food at this point. 
At 1430 I had the synto drip started. I had already been cramping, and soon after began having regular contractions. By 1700, my contractions were 1.5mins apart. My nurse was absolutely wonderful, and had me mostly rest in bed until the contractions became intense. Then I began using the birthing ball. At some point, baby turned, and I had awful back labor. My nurse was awesome at applying counter pressure during my contractions, which helped my back A TON, as did being on the ball. She showed my husband how to apply pressure and help me breathe through contractions. 
She also got me into the recovery position, which she said has seen work wonders for turning babies into optimal position. It was pretty comfy and helped me with my contractions. 
At one point, my contractions were so frequent I felt I didn't have time to recover from one to the next, and was almost ready to beg for an epidural. My nurse was super supportive and helped me breathe and get through these contractions... I was so thankful for her. She ended up giving me fentanyl, and I got a few doses to help me through the next hours contractions. 
At this point I could no longer feel any contractions, which was strange, as if I had had an epidural (I hadn't). They said they would check me again in an hour, and depending how far I was, they would break my water. My water broke on its own at 2035, and at my check I was 7-8 and almost fully effaced. Babys baseline heart rate was also starting to dip a bit, so they stopped the synto to see what my body would do. By this point, I felt constant pressure (rectal and vaginal on and off), and kept saying I felt like I had to push. Baby was also super low, but they told me to breathe through and not to push yet.
At 2125 I asked for more fentanyl because of the pressure and my body felt like I couldn't stop myself from having to push. My nurse was on break, and the nurse covering said she would check me before the fentanyl. She checked me and I was fully, and said you are going to push NOW.... 
They called in the doc, thankfully my obs I had been seeing was on call! I pushed for fifteen minutes. It was the strangest feeling in the world, once her head was so low, I just wanted her out! I pushed maybe five times, and on the second last push my doc told me with one more we would have my baby, and that was all the motivation I needed! Out came the head, then the body immediately after and she was handed to me... 
I'm proud to say I was able to hold off on the epidural. I also can't believe I only pushed for fifteen minutes as a prime! My husband was super supportive, and I'm so incredibly thankful for our nurse... She coached me through my contractions, and saying things like, each contraction brings you closer to your baby, breathe through this ripple of a contraction.. It also helped to visualize ripples in an ocean with each contraction, especially because water plays such a huge part in our memories.. (Met in a park by a river, engaged in Mexico on the beach, and married on the lake by our cabin). Having my husband hear the language she used also helped him to help me, and having her so calm and telling me I was doing a great job helped alleviate his anxieties as well. 
She's been breastfeeding like a champ! I was already hand expressing 3-5mls a time at home beforehand, so I've been helping her along with hand expression. My bottom is sore and bruised, and I've been using ice packs regularly and so looking forward to my firsr sitz bath!

On the down side.... there's an extremely high likelyhood (like 90+%) that this will happen again and you'll have to live with the fear of recurrent dislocations for the rest of your life :)
hashtag/truestory

My first dislocation, I went into shock and the pain settled in soon after. Took over an hour for the ambulance to arrive and even longer to get it reduced at the hospital. The second one, I managed to hike up from a secluded beach and had a taxi take me to the local hospital. The extreme pain didn't settle in until I reached the hospital but fentanyl made the excruciating wait for a doctor just a little bit better. My third dislocation, I was boarding and slipped and that exact motion you did took out my shoulder. I rode down (seriously, the pain doesn't settle in for about 30 minutes in your later dislocations) to a busier area and explained to ski patrol how to do the reduction- while apprehensive, I explained it was not my first dislocation and all she had to do was pull a bit. A reduction is 100x easier before the pain sets in and before your muscles begin to tighten up. All you have to do is follow any one of the methods found online, take a deep breath, and relax, and your shoulder should pop back in if it's not your first ;) And then after that I decided to get my shoulder surgically repaired because I live in Canada and it's all covered... my advice to you is to really work hard on the physio after your first dislocation to re-strengthen your shoulder so that you don't need surgery. Do NOT skip physio. The surgery significantly reduces your chances of reoccurence but it's still not 100% and I play a lot more carefully now. Best of luck in recovery!

One of the biggest issues with people overdosing on heroin has nothing to do with heroin. It's because dealers lace it with fentanyl which is significantly stronger. This is done at random to cause someone to OD and thus drives demand because people think it's higher purity.

For stimulants, AMPAkines, modafinil, AMP citrate, and a few other research chems are excellent and interesting stimulants primarily because they manage to achieve focus, awakeness, and energy with relatively little euphoria (and thus addiction liability)

For opiates, kratom is great. I'd love to see some more low-potency opiates hit the drug scene instead of fucking fentanyl. Compare it to coffee. People are kind of addicted, but it doesn't screw up their lives, and it helps them get through the day. Opiates need more of those sorts.

For deleriants, I'd actually be interested in trying a deleriant if it didn't cause nightmare demon spider hallucinations like DPH or 3-day trips of suffering and organ toxicity like datura.

For sedatives.... well, given how GABA works, I don't think it's possible to come up with a sedative that doesn't have horrible withdrawals. Needs more thought.

And weird random corners of drug land that don't get explored. Like psychedelic nootropics. Like opioid or dopamine-based antidepressants. Like some random thing I haven't even thought of.

I just want to see drug development expand from ""helping sick people"" into ""enhancing normal people"". That would be great.

Modafinil qualifies for this. So do some antidepressants when used on normal people. Some psychs and MDMA also seem to cause long-lasting personality changes, and they are the ones I'm most irritated about getting banned (particularly MDMA. That little shitshow was the specific event that made me decide that I could make better decisions than the DEA and that they do not and should not have authority over me.) Have you ever read ""Chasing the Scream""? It's an excellent book about the drug war.

2016-02-23,exasperation,canada,15,n/a,"Street fentanyl (and heroin and just about all the street drugs) can vary tremendously in purity.  One batch may be 15% pure and another may be 90% pure.  

It's very hard to dose as a powder, so users just use enough to get themselves comfortably high.  And then the next batch is 5x as strong, they use their sense of dose they had with their previous batch, and they overdose.

Another thing that happens is reduced tolerance.  An addict runs out of their regular Dilaudid or Oxycontin supplies, goes through withdrawal.  Can't source their preferred drug, they switch to fentanyl, their tolerance is now very low but they dose for back when they had heavy tolerance, and they overdose.

(That's certainly not all of what's causing the overdoses, but it's part of it.)"
2016-02-23,exasperation,canada,10,n/a,"It's been going on for more than a century.

Diacetylmorphine (also known as heroin!) was a new, amazing, less addictive form of morphine.  Turned out it gave more euphoria and is arguably even more addictive.  Certainly no safer.

Pethidine was a new, amazing, less addictive form of morphine.  Except it's more toxic and just as addictive.


Hydromorphone was a new, amazing, less addictive opioid.  Safer and less addictive than morphine!  Except just as dangerous and addictive as morphine.

Oxycodone was a new, amazing, less addictive opioid.  Safer and less addictive than morphine!  Except just as dangerous and addictive as morphine.

Tramadol was a new, amazing, fully synthetic opioid.  Safer and less addictive than morphine!  Except toxic in different ways and just as addictive.

Fentanyl was a new, amazing, fully synthetic opioid.  Safer and less addictive and morphine!  Except a hundred times as potent which makes it dangerous to dose and just as addictive.

Well, now Fentanyl has a bad name.  So here comes... hm, probably sufentanil or one of those nifty kappa agonists everyone's so excited about.  They'll be marketed as less addictive and safer.  They won't be.

Some countries never really bought into this perpetual opioid treadmill bullshit.  In the UK, morphine remains the preferred drug for moderate to severe pain both in hospital and out of hospital."
2016-02-23,SurrenderTheFlow,AskReddit,10,n/a,"No worries man, totally legitimate question for a non user. It can honestly be both some users just go way too hard and do crazy high amounts at a time. With heroin it's very easy to OD because you simply can't truly know what's in it. It's just gotten stronger and more potent through the years and unfortunately dealers will cut it with Fentanyl(super powerful painkiller than can be bought for cheap and used as cut for raw heroin.) Also a lot of times people will go some time (maybe a few days or weeks) without using so thier tolerance levels are lower than normal and they do too much. I was always scared shitless of Heroin but eventually pain pills get too expensive/hard to find so you make the switch. Of 6 years of using I only OD'd once and it was bad. Narcan literally saved my life. In my case I had done heroin mixed with Fent. It's why you see a lot of older crack/alcohol users in recovery. There aren't too many older people who have done heroin for 30+ years it's just so damn dangerous. Not to say they don't exist cause there are some it's just truly a nasty, nasty, evil ass drug.

Just last week I personally treated multiple heroin/fentanyl overdoses.  Also, last week I was yelled at by patients for not ""giving them what they want"" which often translates to narcotic pain medication.  Part of my compensation as a physician is dictated by ""patient satisfaction"".  Since I practice emergency medicine that is dictated by surveys from patients who are discharged from the ER.  If I piss someone off and they give me a bad score then that effects how I'm paid.  It is much easier for me to give them what they want than to fight them.  Fighting causes them to yell, disrupt other patients, utilize more resources and prevent me from getting to other patients in a more timely manner.  For all of that hard work I get paid less by having a decreased patient satisfaction score.  The federal government has mandated patient satisfaction be part of reimbursement.  Remember this comment the next time you are sitting in the waiting room at an ER for yourself or your family member and wondering what the hell is taking so long.  Your doctor can fight the drug epidemic, get paid less and leave you in the waiting room longer or they can write them a script and have them leave faster/more smoothly but perpetuate the problem.  There is no right answer.

Oxycodone is also pure laboratory quality pharmaceutical whereas heroin could be anything really.  Unless you wash it, which I always did but washes don't save you from fentanyl.

(I don't have a problem with IV drugs either, they can be so great for just taking off some of the edge, and a lot of women do great just with that. Still not judging) That's not what gets me though, it's when these women then go tell their friends and family they delivered ""without an epidural"", and let people assume they did it natural -but fail to mention they were almost unconscious from the drugs. Again, I don't mind how you decide to deliver, but it's not a competition!! And sets unreal goal for others. Just be honest.

Club drugs now include compounds that are highly potent at the sub-milligram range and can prove to be lethal or highly intoxicating at the amounts that you could ingest by sticking your finger in it. (eg. NBoMes, bromo-dragonfly, DOCs, some select 2-Cs, fentanyl or fentanyl derivatives).

Many compounds look like coarse white powders and it can be extremely dangerous to ingest a substance without knowing what it is. "
2016-03-01,Gauss-Legendre,tifu,6,n/a,"Because the intended recreational dose is much smaller than that. In the case of fentanyl, the powder is mixed in with a filler and/or heroin and is supposed to be evenly distributed so as to be active at the amounts used for heroin use (snorting, injection, etc.) but to use less heroin as fentanyl is cheaper and more potent, but these powder mixtures can contain ""hot spots"" where the user may receive a toxic or lethal dose of fentanyl. In the case of the psychedelic compounds, it's expected that a user will be taking VERY small amounts of the substance, but the amount used is only known if you know the compound, as the difference between recreational and toxic doses can be very far apart in the case of compound A or very close together in the case of compound B.

The Tylenol overdoses I see are quite rare (probably a few a year) and almost always a result people intentionally trying to kill themselves, or accidentally overdosing on Tylenol by taking too much cold medicine (usually mixing cold medicines and not realizing they each contain a dose of Tylenol). I almost never see Tylenol overdoses from people abusing narcotocs. Addicts know they cannot take too many Percocet or Vicodin pills because of the Tylenol. It makes many providers more comfortable prescribing the combo pills. Even though the Tylenol might not do much for pain, it is a deterrent to eating your months supply all at once, and certainly makes injecting them more difficult. In overdose situations, Tylenol is quite dangerous but also very treatable if caught within 8h. In normal doses Tylenol is extremely safe, and a very effective fever reducer (especially in people who cannot tolerate NSAIDS). There are lots of dangerous chemicals in your home. Drano is one of the worst, but as long as you don't drink it you are fine. Same with Tylenol - as long as you don't gobble up an handful of Percocets at once there won't be an issue. "

2. Because I needed - and still need, counting the Suboxone - them to do anything. Opiates/opioids fuck with your brain's reward center. When you're taking them, you're flooded with dopamine, and you're at your most creative - or, more likely, the critical voices in your brain shut the fuck up and let you explore this idea or write that sentence without stopping you. In that respect, they're very helpful. **BUT:** They're totally not worth the downtime or instability they cause when you aren't on. 

3. Feverish some days, forcing myself to sit at the desk others, not doing it at all others yet... addicts aren't known for their personal accountability or ability to do things they don't feel like doing at a consistent level. I would go through manic creation phases followed by periods of zero productivity. Even though I write daily now, my creative cycles still sort of mirror this. 

4. If you count Suboxone, yes. I haven't had an illegal drug since I started the program, and science willing I never will again. That said, if I had to quit Suboxone cold turkey, I would definitely not be able to write for a while because of the, you know, crippling withdrawal and all that. 

5. I don't know. I'd be lying if I said my work wasn't largely better when I was donked out on H/Fentanyl/Percocet all the damn time, but it came at a much slower rate, and I'm getting back up to a level of productivity that blows that out of the water while still maintaining 90% of the quality. That said, Floodsick is still the best short story I've ever written... having recently gotten back into the fiction game, though, I'm hoping I can achieve similar results there as I have with contents. 

Sorry for the novel. Topic near and dear to my heart and I really had to restrain myself to keep it this short. If you're a younger writer reading this: **DO NOT RELY ON DRUGS TO MAKE YOU PRODUCTIVE, CREATIVELY SPEAKING, AND DO NOT FALL INTO THE NEED-DRUGS-TO-WRITE TRAP.** Not to go all motivational-speaker on everyone, but I am like the dictionary entry on a promising young life fucked up by the poppy, and I hate myself for it as a person and as a creative professional every goddamn day. There isn't a trip to the doctor goes by that I don't think about crashing my car into something big for wasting all the money I have and hurting all the people I have - myself included in that statement.

2016-03-07,Kataphractos,EnoughLibertarianSpam,6,n/a,"Kind of, but they don't actually want to work at these jobs.  They just want to say that they work because they like thinking about themselves as being ""hard workers"", but instead find ways to goof off and get paid anyways.  The libertarian asshole who I used to be friends with even drove company vehicles while drunk / drugged up, all while having lost his license because he got caught drunk driving one to many times. Even though he was supposed to be in charge of a ""team"" of workers on a job site, he would drop them off in the morning, and pick them up at night, and spend his day driving around looking for drugs, or playing golf, or just sleeping (aka passed out on fentanyl patches).  He would then get super pissed at his co-workers for ""plotting against him behind his back"", even though he was still paid a high salary for the work that his crew did in his absence. Luckily for him, his wife was the company's local branch manager, and he could get away with driving company vehicles without a license, or blowing off his duties so he could go get fucked up. I suspect that it is this relationship that finally led to him being fired for sexual harassment after he asked a female co-worker if he could milk her breasts so he could make ice cream, because it was the only way to get rid of him without his wife being able to protect him.  That was about 5 months ago. He still hasn't gotten another job, which is a bitch when one has a $2k / wk cocaine habit.  Eventually, the problem will solve itself. I suspect that this is all too common when one is dealing with libertarians, who are the most self-centered, petty assholes on the face of this planet. "
2016-03-08,legitxavenged,AdviceAnimals,244,n/a,"Yep, I myself have a condition that puts me at risk for any of my arteries to just tear up and bleed out internally. Also on blood thinners now so thatll just quicken the process. Also could go blind due to retinal detachment. I have nearly died probably 5-6 times total so far and am only 21.

Only thing you can do is just keep forcing yourself forward. I've had 2 open heart surgeries and it never gets easier. Just do what you have to and get it over with.

Edit: having a life threatening condition is not easy. For me, having this condition has transformed who I am. I dont listen to past paced or aggressive music, it gets my heart rate too high. Instead a I listen to slower music, piano concerto's, guys like Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble, Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban. I suffer from depression because my heart efficiency dropped to less than 30% before I had my aortic valve replaced. I was sleeping 12-15 hours a day because of how tired Id get.

During the surgery that was supposed to save my life they screwed something up with the fusion rods in my back making my Trapezius muscles lock up. Its so painful that in a 6 month time period I went to the ER 4 times, twice by ambulance. The last time they had to give me Fentanyl, 2 doses of morphine, and dilauded (in that order) to get the pain under control. I can no longer workout because it could trigger an episode.  The worst part for me is no one in my daily life understands how difficult it is to deal with this all the while going to one of the most academically rigorous universities in the US. 

People always seem to impressed with how I handle the surgeries (up to 5 total, 4 major) and I guess its due in part to being restless. Within 6 months of my last open heart surgery  (May 2015) I was swimming a mile 3 times a week. In reality at the end of the day all I want is to have someone at my side. One day all I want is to have someone to come home to and lay down with, not a single word having to be spoken, they just know everything they need to just by looking. How could I put someone through even a quarter of the amount of stress I experience though? It doesn't seem right to subject another person to that. 

The reality of dealing with a life threatening condition is that if its something that effects your daily life it will change who you are. Its almost unavoidable. All you can do is set your eyes on a main goal and just keep forcing yourself forward to that goal. Its just something that cant be sugar coated. Its not easy, it never is. Having a few key people to keep you in check though allows for some sense of sanity and normalcy. Find those people and keep them close. "

Either you'll be charged in place, or you'll be deported back to the US to face charges on your home soil; either way, the arrest will be a matter of public record by the time you get home. Fentanyl is not a ""well, we'll ignore it this once"" kind of drug, given its relatively high abuse potential.

If you don't want a possession charge on your criminal record, _do not travel with unprescribed schedule II narcotics_. If you can't safely travel because of the risk of fentanyl withdrawal, stay home and work with your doctor to safely wean yourself down, then visit the conference next year."

2016-03-09,questionsfoyou,legaladvice,8,n/a,"OP, please be smart about this and just cancel the trip.  Presenting your research at some conference is not worth the enormous risk you're taking.  Get help with the addiction, and you'll have plenty of of time for conferences and papers in the future when you're well.

But if you're hard-headed enough, at least take steps to mitigate your risk.  If you have time, taper down the amount you take so you'll be less dependant on them, and the withdrawals may be less intense.  Or, if possible, go see an addiction specialist and see if they can place you on a long-acting opioid, like methadone, which may last the entire duration of the trip and prevent withdrawals entirely.  Fentanyl is very short-acting, but there are many opioids out there that have a half-life measured in days.  This may be an ideal solution for you if you can find a physician to work with you.

Finally, many countries, such as the UK, sell codeine and acetaminophen tablets over the counter.  This is similar to the well-known Tylenol #3 in the US, except that it doesn't require a prescription.  You could use those to mitigate the duration and extent of withdrawals.  As you already know, fentanyl is orders of magnitude more potent than most opioids.  So be careful, and make sure you don't take too many of the codeine/acetominophen tablets in an attempt to mitigate withdrawals.  Acetaminophen (also called Tylenol, paracetamol and many other names) is very, very hard on the liver, and you do *NOT* want to take too much of that stuff.  People overdose on that stuff every single day, and it's horrific.  Bleeding out of every orifice horror movie horrific.  

Please consider the good advice you've gotten from people here and good luck.  Either way, please get help.  You will thank me later."

2016-03-09,ImBillBraskyAMA,Drugs,62,n/a,"Combining with other depressants, usually alcohol and/or benzodiazepines.  In combo with opiates, these substances have a synergistic effect - working in combo and seriously lowering the amount needed to OD.  Plus heroin purity differs bag to bag - sometimes cut or replaced with fentanyl which is 80x stronger than heroin.  If people are injecting it's easy to overdo it.  Also affecting all this is that many areas don't have Good Samaritan laws;people on drugs or have drugs on them are scared to report OD's because the cops may ask them questions.

2016-03-13,andsoitgoes42,todayilearned,18,n/a,"And I was on a combo of meds for about 4 years and miserable. 

I think the biggest concern is tolerance levels never plateau in a meaningful manner, so if you're on narcotic pain meds, your body is constantly pushing out all the toxins, which can be a heavy strain. 

What I personally found with the meds is that they would negate my pain, which was nice, but it wouldn't be able to tell my body that it was in pain. After being off for years I took a few during the day and went for a walk. I felt great, and was reminded how I felt when I first began taking them. 

The next day, because I felt so good and energized, I was in agony and I continued to pay for about a week. Let alone the havoc that wreaked on my stomach. 

It also really caused me to struggle emotionally. I was closed off to family and friends. I was treating my depression with endless spending. I would wake up in the morning shaking from being in withdrawal after missing my long acting nighttime dose. I would be impossible to wake in the morning and I would be a wreck in the evening. 

I think the likelihood of it helping people who are in chronic pain is lower than the chance it will turn that person into an addict. 

In my experience, especially talking with others who suffer from chronic pain, let it be your last resort. Medical marijuana doesn't work well for everyone, but it ended up being a less harmful drug for me. It doesn't solve everything and if I take enough to solve everything, I drift off into space. It's a balance, but it's a potential solution for people suffering. 

But the risk of addiction. Even if you avoid the mental addiction, that physical withdrawal is something truly terrifying. I would wake up in the middle of the night in agony. It felt like ants were crawling on my body. My teeth needed to grind. I couldn't get comfortable, my skin felt like it was wrong and I needed to get out. I can still feel it now. And yet I had that in the middle of my usage, and shrugged it off. I would wake up contorted, finally falling asleep once the meds kicked in. 

I know I will need medication at some point for revision surgery, but I'll be damned if I ever go on it for an extended period unless I'm dying.

There is zero reason to use it as a cut as it is expensive, harder to find than MDMA, tiny in dose so that it adds no bulk and it has opposed effects to MDMA.

The amount to keep me well is so much less than to get high, but I can always do just a litttttleeeee more to be floating. And having the self-control not to is difficult. It only takes a couple of binges to raise your tolerance drastically. 

On the other hand, there's a good chance you would die if you IV'ed as little as $2.5 worth (in my area) without a tolerance, but very few users touch needles until their finances necessitate a more efficient ROA.

The particular reason for the rise in OD's is not just the increase in the number of users or the potency, but fentanyl. Fentanyl is both orders of magnitude cheaper than dope ($3-600 a key shipped to your door from certain places on the internet vs. $60k if you even get to that level) and it's 100x stronger. If mixed evenly with the dope, the risk of OD can be mitigated and the bags get a much stronger rush. The addicts usually *want* the fent-laced dope."

Fentanyl is definitely used to raise the ""power"" of dope. Its cheap and adds to the feeling. There are even ""legal"" fentanyl analogues that add to the cheapness. I think part of the real danger is that the dosage levels are crazy small for a single dose. The dose on fentanyl patches are measured by the micrograms per hour. A cheap scale or a bad calculation and the chance of OD goes up a hell of a lot. "
2016-03-15,niandra3,IAmA,10,n/a,"It's mainly because of the huge increase of prescription opiates being prescribed by doctors and sold on the streets in the last couple decades (Also the invention of stronger opiate painkillers. For a long time the most you could get were 5-10mg Vicodin or Percocet. Then Oxycontin came out in dosages of 80mg or more). 

So many young people now (myself and many friends included) are experimenting with painkillers in high school and college, and that becomes prohibitively expensive once you develop a habit. So they move on to heroin which is much cheaper for a very similar high. With greater numbers of opiate addicts, you see more overdoses. 

A lot of this started a few years back when Oxycontin was released and it was [marketed as a ""less addictive"" painkiller.](https://youtu.be/Hx7WLlJzrlw?t=1m5s) Doctors were prescribing heavy duty opiate painkillers like candy for patients with chronic pain, without really educating their patients about the risks of addiction. Now that we know more, they are reducing dosages and not prescribing it as much, but the damage has been done and a lot of patients that are already hooked have to find alternatives (heroin).

It's a major systemic problem and the causes are not just the strength of heroin or Fentanyl. The whole of medicine and especially the approach to treating chronic pain needs to be reevaluated. But to help the people already addicted, we need an overhaul of the criminal justice system that currently views addicts as criminals and treats them as such. This is [really counterproductive](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_everything_you_think_you_know_about_addiction_is_wrong?language=en) and only exacerbates the problem. Effectively removing people from society through imprisonment and disenfranchisement is not ever going to help them get clean and live a healthy life.

2016-03-15,spacenb,ChronicPain,8,n/a,"I was with you until you trashed methadone and Amy Winehouse... Who are we to judge about the pain of others, us who are so frequently judged on ours? Amy Winehouse's pain was just as valid as my pain, your pain and OP's pain, and it must've been pretty damn severe for her to drown herself in drugs to the point of death. OP is not doing that. Methadone is a pain killer, too, and an opioid like any other, oxycodone, hydrocodone or fentanyl. You don't know how many medications she's tried, maybe it's the only one that worked for her, so don't call it crazy that she's taking it."
2016-03-15,Southtown85,AskReddit,275,n/a,"This is a copy pasta from another post months ago. I hope you like it. 

Also, not *technically* a murder attempt considering it was a combat zone. 

I was deployed to Iraq in 2006 and served there for seven months until May 14 2007. I was a Military Policeman deployed there to serve as  Police In Transition Team to train the Iraqi Police on tactics, techniques and procedures; but we were mostly babysitters who bought them very expensive items that they would routinely steal. They then would complain about not having anything at the station; so we would buy more things and repeat the cycle. to say they were  corrupt people is an understatement. 

On May 12, 2007, we received  report in our area that American GIs were being held prisoner  following an ambush on a squad from another division.  The fob initiated a full response to canvas the area looking for a white bongo truck, which is exactly like looking for a black BMW in Germany.  Sadly, we were unable to locate the soldiers, and one was found dead in the Euphrates the next day. Our squad was dispatched to the area to investigate how the police at the checkpoint were unable to see a brightly lit truck pull within a kilometer of them in open desert and not even bother to report headlights. 

On May 14th, we woke early, did PT, ate fast, and loaded up our trucks. I hopped in the turret, mounted my gun, then we headed out towards the checkpoint. We drove out and everything was normal until we encountered  problems with traffic  ignoring us and not pulling to the side of the road as we drove. Looking back, this was a HUGE indicator that something was wrong, but when you're getting pissed off at cars not listening, you don't think all too well. Eventually, threatening to shoot people wasn't even working anymore (once again HUGE FUCKING INDICATOR)! We started having comms issues, my headset wasn't talking to the people below me, my TC, Mike, said ""did you hear that"" which caused me to look down, then BOOM!

Our truck was struck by a 5 array [EFP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_formed_penetrator); one hit the engine block, the next hit the front door, then the back door, then the final one hit the cargo hold. The primary slug easily burst through our door and struck Mike in his right shoulder, burrowing its way though his scapula, and exiting just prior to his spine. This slug of molten copper then hit me in the right thigh just below my hip, followed by the alloy armor that sheared off  six inches above the knee. Because I was standing up and aiming my M4, my left wrist was struck by a large piece of shrapnel and my right hand was peppered by rocks/sand/whatever. I was also struck in the face by small shrapnel. Fortunately, I was wearing my body armor with the neck protector on it, my ACH which shielded my upper head and my Oakley's which shielded my eyes. I did get some peppering on my right side, but with one small exception on my right orbit, I have no ugly scars-just some wicked cool ones that tell my sorry for me. 

After the blast, I was  disoriented, but still had the wherewithal to know that I was bleeding profusely. At the time, I knew my leg  hurt, but I  thought it was a cramp from the stress. I pulled out my IFAK and did as good a job on my wrist and face as I could do, but both of my hands were pretty much useless. I attempted to use a chitosan bandage on my wrist and fought  with the package for what seemed like forever, then just kinda slapped myself in the face.  I tried reporting my injuries to Mike, but he wasn't responding. ""Oh well,"" I thought and assumed he was OK and  just stumbled out of the truck to roam around aimlessly. It was about then that I realized my vision was red and blurry. I about  had a panic attack until I realized my Oakley's were covered in blood and dirt, so took them off and placed them on the spare tire. 

After I got rid of my glasses, I finally started to notice people around me. Also, my leg was starting to ache a bit more.  I was getting one hell of a headache, and I was thirsty. I was also becoming aware that I didn't see Mike. Before I could start looking, my squad leader grabbed me and threw me in another truck. Turns out, when Mike got hit, he was temporarily paralyzed. After they got him out, he started to regain some of his movement and sensation, which at the time, was a bad thing. He suffered third degree burns on the inside of his body and was in utter pain, but our medic was prepared and gave him a Fentanyl lollipop with the explicit instructions for him to just suck on it.  So, what does he do? He gnaws on the damn thing!

We both get medevaced and during the flight, Mike finishes his lollipop(it was supposed to take thirty minutes to finish), and I finally learn the extent of my injuries. When we land, I'm really starting to feel my leg and need help getting out. Mike, who finished his lollipop way too fast, was stoned out of his mind. He had completely forgotten that he was injured and honestly thought that everyone there thought he was famous. He got to the point where he was hitting on all the staff at the helicopter saying things like ""Hey there. Whatchya doin' later tonight?"" to both men and women. After we were lying in triage, he starts yelling for me. ""JONES!!!!! JONES!!!!! JOOOOOOOOOOOOONES!!!!!!!!! I told you they cant fucking kill me!""

After that, I spent two weeks in the hospital where I became well known because my first few hours there, I wound up cussing out either a Lieutenant Commander or Commander (I can't remember) because he was an asshole and ripped out all my wound packing with his sausage fingers. This was the most pain I had experienced, even worse than the explosion itself. I was hurting so much that I wound up bending the rail on my bed and the nurse hit me with the largest morphine dose I was allowed. 

Those two weeks in the hospital were quite fun and I wound up playing hide and seek with everyone in my chain of command because once i got clearance to leave my room, I was never there. Most of the time I would go visit Mike and see how he was doing, then we would walk down to Burger King and eat there. He couldn't spend as much time away from bed as I could because he was on serious pain killers and they only slightly dulled his sensation. He was in good spirits, though, and managed to keep flirting with all the staff, until they would either forget to get his medicine, or thought that it would be rude to wake him up in the middle of the night. Either way, he would rip into them until they were close to crying. 

I wound up taking care of him for about two months after he was released from the hospital. They told him that either I could learn to scrub his back and treat it appropriately, or he could stay in the hospital the whole time. I wanted a drinking buddy, so I happily obliged. Every day, he would take an extra Percocet, take as hot a shower he could stand, and I would prepare to scrub dead skin and dried puss off his back. We bonded quite well during the time and used out combined forces (him in a sling, me in a cane) to our advantage for quite a while. At the bar, everyone wanted to know what happened to us and would buy us drinks. At the barracks, everyone would offer to carry everything for us. People would routinely buy our food for us, and the ladies at the bars loved hearing our story. 

I don't know about him; however, I dealt with some PTSD for a while, but through constantly sharing my story with people, it has now actually become a fond memory and I can recall it with much glee and, depending on the situation, can tell the tale of this terrible day in a way that makes people laugh rather than stare in mortification. One other thing that truly helped me was I took my scars and turned them into a story on their own. I have a tattoo surrounding them. It's a snake making an ""S"" around the two scars. The snake represents evil. The scars and date of the incident move vertically forming a ""$"" representing money is the root of all evil. my lower scar represents an explosion and has two drops of blood on it symbolizing me and Mike. The upper scar is flames with three drops of blood and it represents the three people we lost in the fire of battle. Murchison, Farrar, and Horner(Rest in peace). 

TL;DR: I was blown up in Iraq. Read my wall of text!

2016-03-17,papaeverkid,Drugs,15,n/a,"For most people , Heroin fucks up their lives. When I first started doing heroin when I was 18, I had $4,000 in my bank from working my whole senior year and I was clean. When I first started using, my bank account dropped to $200 from buying all that dope after about 4 months. Drugs like MDMA, Coke, LSD are usually drugs that people like to do once on a Friday night or weekend only. Coke is a little conterversial with this however, I feel like coke is abused a lot, but it is way too expensive for someone to use it everyday though. With heroin it is a daily thing. People use it at work (using at the bathroom stalls) and they use it every where pretty much. Also the overdose rate is really high with heroin. Sometimes it is cut (or just is) with fentanyl or other fentanyl derivatives and people (like Philip Seymour Hoffman) die from one shot. After 4-5 years I did an Ibogaine treatment and it really helped me out a lot. I stopped using for 9 months. I started using again (due to being really depressed) and now it is not as addictive anymore. I just buy 5-10 stamps every 4-5 months and when its gone, its gone. However I do cheat, I take Kratom (mimic opioid) daily for school. Heroin really deserves the negative stigma though. The shittiest people I have met were heroin junkies. One time I invited 3 of my junkie friends in my house to shoot up. I went to the bathroom and when I came back, I saw my ipod had gone missing.

Try to remember the good memories you have with Colton. Don't be afraid to remember any bad memories - it's healthy to remember the person for who they truly were, for their strengths as well as their flaws. Some people just have an idealized version of someone after they pass - I think this only makes it harder to move on because you don't want to let go of your perfect memory. Remember the good and the bad, times you had fun and times you got in trouble (those can be fun too). Every memory you have, try to cherish each one. The stronger your collection of memories, the longer you will be able to reminisce and feel close to him. That's why I say try to remember anything you can - it'll help you form a more complete picture of him in your mind. None of us are perfect, and those of us who choose to expiriment can be very flawed. But anyone of us who choose this lifestyle and do end up passing away - we still leave behind people that loved us. Often the circumstances are tragic, we go too young and with promising futures. These people leave parents and friends to mourn and ask why, and all we can do is cherish the person for who they were, all their positive and negative traits.  Try to remain strong for your friend and those close to him. If you need to talk you can PM me - I've dealt with a ton of loss and I can try and offer some life advice.


Stay safe guys. Try to buy from people you know well. Do test shots. Read the news and see if fentanyl might be in your area. Don't drive if you are inebriated.

2016-03-20,Old-Goat,ChronicPain,7,n/a,"While they may have balked at the cost of the butrans patch, there are plenty of other opiates in both long and short acting varieties that your insurance will likely approve. Buperenorphine (aka bupe) is the active ingredient in suboxone too, so its doubtful they will approve that either without a need for opiate detoxification in connection with opiate addiction. That is basically what bupe with or without the naltrexone is used for. There are many cheaper (and frankly far better) options to treat pain.

While you seem to have the idea of tolerance down pat, I fear you are misinformed about what addiction is and what it isn't. Your body being used to a drug to the point of a withdrawal syndrome of some kind if that drug is ceased suddenly is called dependence. Some people prefer the qualifier ""physical"" in front of the term. Physical dependence happens from almost all medications. Anti depressants, anti seizure drugs, barbiturates, muscle relaxants, cardiac drugs... the list goes on forever. If you dont take your daily medications, you body will react, usually quite negatively. Bona fide addiction occurs when someone can not stop a harmful behavior, even after understanding that behavior is causing them harm. This goes for drug addiction as well as gambling, sex, video gaming, eating... again, a list that goes on forever. Physical dependence is completely normal and expected after a couple weeks of solidly taking opiates. Addiction is not normal, and is a psychological issue which kind of makes it easier for you to tell if you have an addiction problem. If you are honest with yourself and are taking a drug for legitimate pain, the odds of you having an addiction issue are small. Most people know deep down if they are bullshitting themselves about their pain. That doesnt sound like you right now. Would you give up opiates forever to walk without pain again? If it took more than 1/2 second to decide you may want to ask your doctor if they think you have an issue, but I think you would still be on safe ground. Our reactions do slow as we age (not implying anything except to myself).

I wouldnt worry too much about the pain doc having a better option for you to consider. I would definitely let them know about your kidney situation since opiates can make complete bladder emptying difficult and the side effect that is almost inescapable is chronic constipation. That would complicate your situation I would imagine. A low dose transdermal fentanyl patch might be a work around, but pain treatment is highly individualized, so your doctor (if he's/she's good) will know best. Hang in there.    "

Usually after they have built a tolerance to hydro/oxycodone,  then they are usually moved to hydromorphone (dilaudid), fentanyl, or oxymorphone, depending on what the doctor feels is appropriate.

In terms of effects, i think it does blow oxy out of the water.  Its actually quite insane how potent it is, but its not just potent, it is very strong and euphoric.  I don't have an opiate tolerance, but I could crush a quarter of a quarter  of a 10mg Opana and snort a thin line as long as my thumbnail and be ripped.

2016-03-21,Wintryfog,Drugs,7,n/a,"(Part 3 of the field guide to snakes)

**Oxycodone/OxyContin:** A highly desirable opiate. Quite euphoric and nice. Correspondingly higher pain-killing power, cost, and addictiveness. Less available because of the crackdown on opiate prescriptions. Because it became so expensive and hard to get a hold of after opiate prescriptions were restricted, many people switched to heroin because it was cheaper. Stay away.

**Hydromorphone/Dilauid:** A rather euphoric opiate that doesn't last very long at all. Often used in hospitals. Stay away.

**Oxymorphone/Opana:** Same as above, but even better. Supposed to be even better than heroin, but it doesn't last very long at all. Stay away.

**Heroin:** This is one that easily deserves its negative reputation. Yes, it really is as addictive as everyone says, yes, it will fuck up your life. Not once, not ever. Stay the fuck away.

**Fentanyl:** An opiate even more powerful than heroin. Less euphoric, more sedating. A common cause of overdoses because since it's so incredibly potent, dealers put a bit in their heroin to increase the potency and compensate for cutting it to increase profit. The problem is that it doesn't often get mixed well in with the heroin, so you can hit a hot spot and fatally overdose on it with the respiratory depression. Stay away.

**Loperamide:** Available over the counter. An opiate that doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, so it's pretty useless for getting high unless you add other things to make it work. However, it is really useful for opiate withdrawals because it will defer the withdrawals in the rest of your body (just not your brain), removing a good chunk of the suffering of opiate withdrawls (but they still suck)

**Sedatives:** Generally cause lowered inhibitions, sleepiness, amnesia, and that sort of fun stuff. Kind of like dissociatives, you can use them, but keep them as an infrequent thing. Also, the withdrawals of this class are horrible, sometimes topping opiate withdrawals. Also, don't combine with alcohol, just like opiates, it makes it far worse and you could die or do something incredibly stupid.

**Alcohol:** Nuff said. Alcohol also acts as a mild dissociative as well.

**Benzodiazapenes (Xanax, Valium, Etizolam, etc..., just anything whose chemical name ends with -lam or -pam):** When used responsibly (like once in a while when you have a panic attack), these are amazing at removing stress and panic. They are also really good to use when having a bad trip on psychedelics, they just cut right through it. Chronic or recreational use, however...these cause inhibition loss, amnesia, redosing (because you forgot that you took them), really stupid actions, and passing the fuck out, when used irresponsibly. Which seems to happen more than usual on these ones, probably because of the inhibition loss. Sort of addictive, and the withdrawals are hideous, the worst of any drug, counting heroin. You absolutely have to taper down over several months if you try to quit. They are way overprescribed, having a daily script is just a recipe for getting hooked. The amnesia and inhibition loss means that these are the date-rape drugs everyone has been freaking out about (although, really, alcohol does the same thing, just less efficiently, and it is the most commonly used date-rape drug). And doing stupid shit... I'll just say that given some of the stories of what people have woken up to or done after doing benzos, The Hangover was practically a documentary. They nailed it absolutely. Avoid generally unless there is some panic-inducing situation upcoming. Even then, I'd rather use propranolol.

**GHB:** The evil date-rape drug. Actually, quite a bit better than everyone makes it out to be (unlike heroin, meth, and pcp, which actually are that bad). Like alcohol but far more euphoric. Also makes you super horny. Inhibition loss also happens, like with alcohol. No real hangover, instead, you wake up feeling very refreshed. Also, use must be quite frequent in order to build a tolerance and bad withdrawal, so I'd say it's not particularly addictive just due to the frequency of use needed to fuck yourself over. The three main things to note are as follows. Do not ever drink on it. You will pass out and maybe die. Also, it has a rather thin dosage window between ""euphoric giggly sexy"" and ""passed the fuck out and don't remember a thing"", so know exactly how much you are taking. Also, the highly refreshed woken up feeling may be neurotoxic, so combine it with a little bit of DXM for neuroprotection.

**Phenibut:** Legal. A Russian anti-anxiety drug. Like the serene, sociable side of alcohol. Rather subtle, I personally enjoy it quite a bit. It doesn't impair you at all, just makes you sociable and a bit happy and introspective. Also don't think it causes amnesia. Would recommend. It also has a reverse hangover of feeling better than normal the next day. Things to note are... Do not combine with alcohol. Also, it takes like 3 hours to kick in, so don't go ""fuck this isn't working, better redose"". Also, tolerance develops very very fast to it, so keep it to once a week at most.

**Ambien:** Sedative, notable for causing bizarre behavior if you don't get to sleep and total amnesia the next day. Like the Hangover, but far weirder. Highlights include having multiple crates of freeze-dried survival food show up in your driveway a week later, crashing your car, waking up in a puddle of molten icecream, sending flirty misspelled messages to all your crazy exes, accidentally writing an award-winning essay, waking up to find the word ""BATH"" written in your bathtub with duct tape, and purchasing llamas. It is an adventure you'll never remember.

**Stimulants:** Make you super hyper and energetic yay! The main thing to note is to remember to eat, drink, and sleep. Never stay up more than one night on stimulants. Also, some can be quite addictive.

**Caffeine:** Well duh.

**Nicotine:** Subtle, mildly calming. If you are using this, stick to patches and gum for the love of god. Cigarettes are incredibly addicting because they have chemicals in them that inhibit dopamine breakdown in the brain. Also, inhalation is one of the fastest-acting and most addictive routes of administration, only beaten out by IV injection. Nicotine is pretty safe by itself, but the other stuff in cigarette smoke definitely isn't. But if you are using patches, they make good study and work aids. Plus, if you leave them on at night, you get super vivid dreams that might be lucid.

**Modafinil:** Prescription medication used for narcolepsy. Holy shit I love this stuff. Less addictive than caffeine, 12-14 hour half life, loads of focus and energy and will to do things without feeling tweaky, 8 hours of pure flow state, easy to get, no crash, and you get tons of stuff done. The problems are that it may cause allergic reactions in some people, it makes your pee smell bad, it can mess with sleep, it doesn't work in some people and only works a bit in others, it inhibits birth control a bit, and if you use it more often than 2x a week, tolerance builds. But still, it's excellent. If you are very worried about the law, Adrafinil is the legal version of modafinil that is a bit shittier, requires higher doses, and puts a bit more strain on your liver. Get it.

**Ritalin:** An ADHD med. Characterized by loads of focus, energy, low appetite, sociability, and a crash afterwards. Kind of like Adderall, it's a study drug, and has similar pitfalls. Be cautious, because tolerance and addiction is a thing. It is different in some way than Adderall, but I don't know much about it.

**Cocaine:** Addictive, feels excellent, costs a whole lot, very commonly cut with other stuff, short duration, toxic to your heart. Stay away.

**Crack:** Cocaine but extremely addictive, even shorter lasting, and even more euphoric. Deserves its terrible reputation. Stay far away.

**Amphetamines/Adderall:** Loads of focus and energy, high sex drive, your penis doesn't really want to cooperate, euphoria, useful for binge-studying, making everything interesting, typing novels, and that sort of stuff. Atlas Shrugged was written on it. High-level colleges have an epidemic of ADHD diagnoses now. Tolerance and addiction are a thing with this one, be careful. Crashes also happen. If you insist on using amphetamines, try Vyvanse. The body has to metabolize it to amphetamine, so you get a constant flow through the day to get stuff done instead of a surge. Also, if you stay up too long on amphetamines (like 4 days straight) you get psychosis. Eat, sleep, don't redose, keep it to once or twice a week.

**Meth:** Like Adderall but much more so. Commonly has bad impurities in it. Incredibly tempting to redose and addictive. Most of the damage and craziness comes from staying awake for weeks and neglecting food and your health. Very very euphoric. Deserves its bad reputation. If you decide to use it, use it orally, don't smoke it because that is way more addictive. Stay away.

**Benzedrex:** Legal, over the counter meth. You can find the little inhalers at a variety of stores. If you remove the cotton rod and soak it in lemon juice, it extracts the proplylhexedrine. Very euphoric and focusing and energetic, a bit like meth, but tweakier. Causes insane vasoconstriction, don't take the whole rod worth of propylhex. Some people love it and some people hate it. It's kind of like having amphetamines with no prescription. The problem is the loads of vasoconstriction (doesn't play well with your heart) and it also has an absolutely brutal comedown (that can be sort of alleviated with 5-HTP). Not a good idea.

**Pyrovalerones:** aka bath salts. A variety of compounds that cause a lot of euphoria, are very short lived, a high compulsion to redose, and a lot of paranoia. Incredibly shitty. Stay far away."

We already have buildings which house all kinds of addictive drugs now, they're called pharmacies. Maybe you'd need some level of security, but I don't think you'd need prison like security as you're suggesting.

> I only see legalizing hard drugs as a viable option in that you would be able to set a price on something like heroin, that could be 3-4X the street value. 

That completely defeats a major benefit of legalization, eliminating the black market. If you artificially inflate the price of the legal drugs to higher than the illegal alternative, nothing will change.

> Decriminalizing would be smart, because it removes the stigma of being a ""junkie"" or ""drug abuser."" 

I think legalization is much better than simple decriminalization for numerous reasons, including eliminating the black market and all the violence associated with it, having unadulterated drugs with proper dosages available thus preventing most of the accidental deaths due to overdose, etc, however, I think decriminalization is much more practical and certainly a good first step.

> We need to rein in large pharmaceutical companies as well, because it is easier to find Oxycontin and other Rx painkillers than actual illicit drugs.

Actually, Oxycontin and other Rx painkillers are typically much more expensive on the black market vs. more dangerous opiates like heroin or fentanyl which are more widely available and cheaper."

2016-03-23,BimJeamThom,TheBarons,6,n/a,"Here's my bit of armchair detective work:

The pill pictured, assuming it is one of the ""lethal"" pills, appears to be rather unimpressive (pardon the pun), made with a hammer press rather than a machine punch.

The shoddy pressing, and the fact that these have caused 9 deaths in and around Pinellas county leads me to believe that the manufacturer is someone selling them locally, rather than shipping in bulk, as the profit margins achieved versus the time/effort taken to produce such bulk quantities with a hammer press are moronic.

More Mental Gymnastics:

The manufacturer of these particular pills orders their alprazolam powder for their small time supplemental income operation from, most likely, a Chinese chemical vendor. The same vendors found on guidechem that provide all sorts of RC's, including a fairly recent one known as W-18.

W-18 is an μ-opioid antagonist that is so potent as to have an LD50 (the dose at which 50% die) is 25 micrograms for the average weight of a US male, 88.3 kg (195 pounds) 
*Albeit this LD50 stat comes from very limited data due to its relative newness*

The manufacturer was obviously aware enough of the pressing process and the necessary binders/additives to pass it off as a sellable product.

So why would they want to put more than 2mg of the active ingredient? That would only cut into their margins. 

The LD50 of Fentanyl is .03 mg/kg. Which means that the average weight of a US male, 88.3 kg (195 pounds), would put their LD50 at approx 2.65 mg.

Add in the fact that Fentanyl Powder is much more expensive than W-18, which is why it has actually become a common ingredient in [Fake Fentanyl Pills] (http://globalnews.ca/news/2483506/new-drug-w-18-100-times-more-powerful-than-fentanyl-calgary-police/).


I believe that this is a case of a low output, street dealer/manufacturer accidentally receiving a bag of W-18 instead of the Alprazolam powder that they ordered. 


However, I could also see /u/zman3000's theory of one twisted motherfucker doing this shit.

2016-03-23,jrafferty,news,12,n/a,"My wife has a condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) which is a chronic pain disorder caused by trauma or surgery.  Over the past 8 years she has been on everything from methadone to fentanyl patches to currently percocet 4x day.  Even on the narcotics she lives her life at a constant 7 out of 10 pain level.  She used to take Ambien to help her sleep through the pain, but the pain management clinic she sees stopped prescribing it entirely due to the dangers associated with it.  She has used marijuana to help with sleep and to supplement from the narcotics (On weed she could take 2/day and be ok instead of 4/day).  Since the beginning (about 5 years now) the clinic has never cared about marijuana.  They did regular drug tests to ensure she isn't using illegal drugs, using more narcotics than they are prescribing (getting them elsewhere), or not as much as they are prescribing (selling pills instead of taking them) but they never cared about a positive marijuana test to the point that they never even asked if she had a script much less asked to see it.  That changed in January 2016 when she was told that due to new federal regulations they were now required to test for marijuana and if a positive test was given then the patient would get one warning and any subsequent positive test would result in that patient no longer being prescribed narcotics of any kind.  A patient can choose to use either marijuana or narcotics to help manage their pain...but not both.

The result of this is that my wife stopped smoking weed which resulted in an increase in the amount of narcotics she's taking daily (2 pills to now 4 pills) and she has also picked up a new prescription for Lunesta to help her sleep since she can't smoke now which adds another drug to her system and another purchase at the pharmacy from Big Pharma.

There's something to be said about not just selling the hardest drugs to anyone but honestly, the most dangerous drugs are  research chemicals that are in a legal grey area, totally unstudied and sometimes much, much more dangerous than any historically ""dangerous"" drug, see bath salts, spice etc. For example, today you can buy some stuff from China called W18, it's 50-100 times as potent as fentanyl which is 50-100 times as potent as heroin. Its so potent that you could actually overdose from inhaling an invisible amount of dust and this is readily available to anyone dumb enough to order it and take it (you'll almost certainly die if you do so I don't recommend it) but do you see the problem here? Heroin is actually the SAFER alternative. 

Today it's more likely in some areas if you try to buy heroin, you actually receive fentanyl that was synthesized in a clandestine lab in Mexico because you don't need to grow anything to make fentanyl, it's super potent so you can cut it many many times and it still gets you high. Now, junkies aren't the wisest people sometimes and having no ability to verify what it is they're taking, they are likely to overdose since it's very hard to measure fentanyl in terms of your normal dose. This is why decriminalization simply isn't enough, we need full legalization and regulation.

Ultimately it's like blaming a gun store for a homicide involving a firearm.  It's illogical, except in the case of a faulty gun that exploded in the person's hand or some-such ... and then you are blaming the manufacturer unless the gun dealer modified the gun or some bullshit.

They are doing it purely for profit, to say their heroin is pure and strong

On top of that, even the folks who DO create the even concoctions of H/fentanyl, these still kill people.  In the olden days it was H addicts returning to their normal ways, and using their old doses.  This would kill them due to their lack of tolerance.  Now it is ridiculous, anything to make money.  

There is heroin out there spiked with fentanyl/fent analogues that would down even the most tolerant opioid dependent person.

The people who are putting it together only care about the profits they make, maybe they'll tell you to ""only take half of what you normally do"", harm reduction is on the bottom of their priority list

You can be as tolerant as you want on opioids and you'll still run a danger doing spiked H (which you will never know if you have or not)"

There is a direct relationship between this issue (our general lack of empathy for men suffering addiction) and the disproportionate suicide rate. I would have certainly killed myself in 2008 except my daughter was born and I had no choice anymore. 

The key to understanding the opiate epidemic is two fold:

1) Opiates, especially short acting opiates (oxy contin, Fentanyl, etc) are the **MOST EFFECTIVE anti-depressants** known to man. Period. And this is well known in the industry. 

2) Big pharma choose to market short acting opiates as if they are low risk for addiction. Prescriptions went up by 700%. It turned out, not only were they wrong, but they knew full well that short acting opiates are, in fact, the **MOST ADDICTIVE**.

So what do we have? We have a substance that is the best anti-depressant ever invented that turns out to be extremely addictive. What could go wrong?

2016-04-01,jadedgoldfish,VetTech,8,n/a,"A few tips as to what to brush up on:

Thoracic compressions: You want to compress 1/3-1/2 of the depth of the chest and then release fully off of the chest. As a generalization, women tend to not push hard enough and men tend to not let off of the chest between compressions. At least 100 compressions per minute.

Ventilation: Don't bag them too quickly. 10 breaths per minute. It's easy to start squeezing quickly when adrenaline hits.

Intubation: Get used to intubating in every position. Learn to intubate in lateral recumbancy. Learn how to intubate when they're on their backs. It's useful for *everyone* but isn't taught nearly enough.

Read the RECOVERY initiative front to back.

Practice drawing blood off an IV catheter when you place it. It's not likely to hemolyze in an 18 or 20 gauge catheter and saves you and your patient 2 minutes, which can be a life/death difference.

Brush up on your drugs. Most GPs don't carry the drugs that an ER will, particularly a bigger one. Methadone is my very best friend at work. I can give it SQ, IM, IV or even orally.

Don't kill them in radiology. Just because there are xrays on the list of orders for the heart failure dog doesn't mean you take the films. You wait until they're breathing improves and then you xray. If your doctor pushes the issue, push back. No animal should ever die from an xray, but it happens.

And the biggest thing -- you are there to advocate for your patients. There are more patients at any time in a busy clinic than there are techs or doctors. If you notice something, say something. Don't let an animal sit in pain because 3 mcg/kg/hr of fentanyl *should* be enough. Also, don't forget you need to give an initial injection of pain meds when starting a CRI. If they don't get them on admission, it's not enough to start the CRI and wait for it to catch up."

I'm not trying to sound like a dick, but your wife needs help. I hope she gets it. What makes people intentionally do too much heroin so that they risk their lives just to scare their husband? Serious mental issues (no offense--I mean it)...that's not a normal addict move, my man. Usually when someone ODs, it's because they underestimate the strength of their heroin, or overestimate their tolerance, or it's laced with fentanyl. I'm sorry you had to see that. It is indeed very traumatizing. "

2016-04-03,purgingitall,news,7,n/a,"Pot is used in some of our ceremonies. In saying that you're blamed for the actions of other people, do you think I blame you for anything? Because I promise you I don't. Anything related to my people is water under the bridge imo. But that's just me. My family isn't like that either. 

However, because we've pretty much always used marijuana and peyote, before puritans settled this land, how could you take that away from people? Why do you think it's okay to do that? 

I'm not anti-pharma. I'm anti-addiction. Don't put words into my mouth. I work in medicine. I know the importance of pharmaceuticals. I also know the importance of responsible prescribing. There are times that people need substances stronger than marijuana, but often times they don't. I can't tell you how many times I've seen lortab or lorcet prescribed to a patient coming into the ER with a headache. And this isn't at one hospital. This isn't in one city, it's not even in one state. This is a nationwide observation. And why? So that they can end up getting hooked on them? Then they graduate to roxycontin, oxy, dilaudid, morphine  or fentanyl. I mean these things happen whether people want to believe it or not. 

In reference to your belief that I've only used THC medicinally this once (surgery) is not true. I've used it several times medicinally. To me, you sound as if you're advocating for pills, but anti-marijuana. Is that the case? "

2016-04-04,dramboxf,AskReddit,19,n/a,"There's a small debate in the EMS policy crowd. It used to be that giving Morphine or Fentanyl on the ambulance was only done in the cases of MI, hip fracture or femur fracture. Things that are ""proven"" to cause a ton of pain. This would be the 80s and early 90s. 

Then there was a movement for medics to give pain meds for anyone that asked for them. The job of a medic, it was argued, is to ease pain. Withdrawal from narcotics is a miserable, painful experience. Even if the patient IS drug-seeking, it was argued, it's not the job of the medic to withhold the drug in order to ""teach"" the addict some asinine lesson. 

Then the counter-argument came in that if EMS paramedics just started handing out morphine and fentanyl to every Tom, Dick and Harriet that asked, we're creating a revolving door of addicts calling 911 to get their fix and taking away ALS assets (paramedic ambulances) from potentially true life-threatening cases. 

A paramedic's drug kit, depending on the state and the particular EMS system can have 30 or 40 drugs in it. One of them is Narcan, an opiate antagonist that instantly counter-effects any narcotic. Overdose on heroin? Here's 2mg of Narcan in your IV, and it's literally like flipping a light switch. One moment the patient could be circling the drain in respiratory distress, the next ten seconds they're awake and alert. (And usually pissed off.) In that same drug box are at least one, possibly 2 or 3 narcotics.  "

They have gotten there dope making skills down to a science (probably started from them refining and still refining some of the best Coke around). I got dope and Coke in Colombia when there for a month and a half and the dope was powder that did not tar up. The Mexicans (where all of or tar on the west coast comes from isn't as refined as ECP but has more opiod alkaloids it so it is a different, sometimes better high IMO) and I've tried both. The Mexicans are starting to get there shit together to try and compete with the Colombians and we're are slowly starting to get powdered H (that doesn't tar up when breathed on; most powdered tar that tars up when breathed on is usually just tar cut with lactose to make it a powder). The few batches a beige powdered H that I have gotten in The city of Angels has been extremely good, pricer than tar, but a little goes a long way compared to tar. The high has been exactly like the highs I've had from ECP, the legs are longer and the high is different. I know for a fact it is coming from Mexico and not Colombia and have heard from different sources that the Mexicans have finally figured out how to make a better product but are still flooding the streets with tar because they can sell it cheaper, make it cheaper, and people are still craving it so why change something that is working good for them already.

Edit: Also forgot to add that we are also getting a lot of Fent or Fent analogues here in Los Angeles lately. The difference is that, at least the people I deal with are at least selling it as Fentanyl and not as Dope and are telling their customers to be careful with it. Because a dead customer is no use to them anymore. I think the problems with Fent going around is that smaller dealers are sold it and told it is Fent, but then they decide to try to cut it themselves without knowing how to properly cut a substance to make it where the agent is evenly distributed (can take quite a bit of time and is more than just mixing two powders together) and then try and sell as dope but because of being cut poorly the ditibution of Fent can very greatly from bag to bag (probably just cut it with lactose or some benign substance but don't cut it properly so you get bags that very greatly from very potent to not potent at all). So people shoot one bag and are fine, go for their next bag and bam."

2016-04-04,tardigrades_arf,Portland,8,n/a,"I've thought about approaching Gus van Sant for help with this. Lobby the state legislature to allow supervised injection facilities *along with* subsidizing the purchase of safe, clean, medical-grade diamorphine like Zurich did. Cut out the [cartels](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/us/crime-spike-in-st-louis-traced-to-cheap-heroin-and-mexican-cartels.html?_r=0), cut out black markets with shady street deals, cut out the rampant theft and panhandling for drug money. Cut out the unpredictability of street heroin's varying degrees of purity, reducing overdoses.

Van Sant took us part of the way, with the needle exchange at Outside In. But the junkies still have to go harass Psycho Safeway customers to get their drug money (or break into cars), and they're often nodding out in the worst spaces imaginable and in the event of overdoses the ambulances may not arrive in time.

Subsidized heroin would also help addicts who want to get clean *actually succeed*, by providing that guaranteed level of potency/purity, which makes prescribing gradually reduced doses *possible.*

And as I've said elsewhere, [**ibogaine**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine) is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet. Sure it would cost some money to implement an ibogaine program. But it wouldn't be as expensive as maintaining people with a constant supply of diamorphine, and surely it could pencil out to be even *less* expensive than our currently existing methadone or suboxone maintenance types of programs. Yet I don't know of anyone lobbying to provide ibogaine treatment for our addicts. A campaign to provide ibogaine would have to be ready to face some challenges: Federal drug laws prohibit it here. Taxpayers (especially ones not living in Portland) would likely shoot down any ballot measure that's asking the public to pay to provide ""free drugs to drug addicts.""

2016-04-04,Mycotoxicjoy,gif,6,n/a,"I'd rank any opiate highly because there is such a potential for abuse and the withdrawal symptoms are horrific. Moreover you build up a tolerance the more you use them so if your doctor prescribed you some hydrocodone for knee pain in some cases people develop a tolerance and need a much greater dose for the same effect. It's a slippery slope from getting a perscription to using heroin or even worse fentanyl. Moreover opiates have been fucking our world over for centuries and billions have been affected by their cultivation, distribution, and consumption

Following that would be Cathanones, more commonly known as bath salts. These were plant based compounds that were injested and caused mild highs and euphoria. Now they are synthesized in mass quantities in labs in China where cleanliness is just an abstract concept and given as an adulterant to ecstasy. The effects of these drugs are terrifying and ODs come with a single dose but not before you wreck your vascular system by hulking out in excited delirium.

2016-04-04,MzTerri,relationships,28,n/a,"Yeah, methadone isn't a first line defense. For your info- I'm a chronic, long term pain patient. I'll likely have some measure of it for life. A good day for me on a scale of 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever) is a 4. On a bad day, I don't move from a ball where-ever I happen to be.
I was put on codeine.
Then after codeine, went to norco.
After norco alone wasn't dealing with the pain was put on a low dose of fentanyl.
Then a middle dose of fentanyl.
Then a high dose of fentanyl.
Then fentanyl with norco.
AFTER ALL OF THOSE STEPS- they OFFERED me methadone and because of ALL of the negative reasons people in this thread have given you (as well as the fact that a certain percentage of people who take methadone suddenly have their heart just STOP on the first use) I declined. I'd rather be in pain at a 4 on a 'good' day than have the risks associated with that drug. Also- today was a good day and I (while on meds) did dishes, cooked/dealt with food for our household, took care of my toddler, went to the gym, etc.

If your DH has chronic pain, he needs to see appropriate physicians for it, and get it managed, and find a way to live with it. Anything else is him holding you a prisoner. Make that a stipulation of your being willing to work on the relationship. Honestly, him being unable to look at you or look after a baby combined with his addiction makes me think that he's got a heroin issue. At this point in addition to the proper pain management, I'd request a drug test (you can buy them at CVS) as well as once a week al-anon or narc-anon meetings. For your info as well, pain management physicians make you consent to randomized drug testing, so that may be a part of why he's unwilling to go see one yet is in 'so much pain'.

2016-04-10,orangesunshine,opiates,6,n/a,"There's a huge gap between what's required to overdose and what is considered an appropriate dosage in the medical setting.

Though in the context of addiction and recreation users often push their own limits.  This is especially dangerous with new users, both because they might not know their limits yet ... and because they have much lower tolerances getting very intoxicated even off of small doses.

For me at least, as long as I'm not mixing drugs I've developed such a tolerance that I'm not sure I could overdose ... or more precisely the amount required to achieve an overdose would be so far outside of what I normally use that it could *never* happen as an accident.

I also don't get the stereotypical ""nod"" I did in my very early days of using.  When I take very high doses, I tend to become much more alert than I am sedated.  Even my heart-rate and blood-pressure rises instead of falls.

If I have even a small amount of alcohol though, I very quickly become sedated like you would expect.  I think other than fentanyl adulterants in street heroin, mixing with other CNS depressants is the next most dangerous thing addicts encounter.  It really amplifies the danger much more than i think many realize.

So while I don't believe I could accidentally overdose off of what I know is a pure pharmaceutical morphine/heroin/etc ... I could *easily* accidentally overdose when mixing drugs intentionally ... or worse still un-intentionally if there was a little alprazolam mixed in with my street heroin.

I'm scared to take even small doses of both opioids and benzodiazepines together.  When I do take a benzodiazepine, I tend to take as little opioids as I need.  Though I know loads of users out there aren't that cautious, and this is where I believe most end up *accidentally* overdosing.  They believe they know their limits and while they might, it's such a fine line that if you are trying to get heavily intoxicated off that combo it's a sure-fire way to end up in the ER or worse.


As far as set and setting go, I really don't think it has the potential to be the difference between life and death.  Maybe if you were in an extremely relaxing environment it could result in you nodding off, becoming difficult to wake, and thus having an ""overdose"" you would not have experienced in a more stimulating environment.  Though I don't think you could actually die in that case.  

If you have enough opiates in your system to result in your death, it's not going to matter if you are falling out of an airplane or being spooned by your spouse."
2016-04-10,outrunningzombies,IAmA,82,n/a,"I'm a nurse who works at poison control.

Yes, it's pretty busy. We get calls from home (my toddler ate...) and the hospital (mostly, but not exclusively, suicide attempts). Edit: we also handle venomous critters like rattlesnakes and scorpions in the southwest.

If you can think of it, someone has eaten it. Plants, medicines, pesticides, car products. Toddlers put EVERYTHING in their mouths, suicidal people will try a lot of things out of desperation, and alcoholics will drink almost anything to get drunk.

I was an ER RN before I did this. I work with pharmacists and nurses with a variety of backgrounds. I was given 3 months of training with our doctors and experienced staff on the most common and most deadly poisons (not necessarily the same thing) before I started taking calls. I was monitored on all my calls until management felt I was competent.

I took this job because I wanted to get out of full time ER work and it looked interesting. I'd called poison control plenty of times from the ER so I had a vague idea of what I was getting into.

On drugs and alcohol: Alcohol is ok on moderation. I don't have a lot of issues with regular pot, as it rarely causes hospitalizations. Beyond that, you don't know what you're getting and I think it's incredibly stupid to end up in the ER because you wanted to get high. Is it heroin or fentanyl? Is it Molly or meth? And if you ordered a research drug online, why are you trusting your life to some random stranger?

Some misconceptions here--no, we don't always tell you to go to the ER. Nationally, 90% of calls from home are kept at home. NEVER MAKE SOMEONE THROW UP. That hasn't been recommended since I was a toddler. If someone is sick enough to need the stuff in their stomach out, we will send you to the hospital for charcoal. No, you can't give those over the counter charcoal tablets/capsules or even charcoal briquettes for the grill--you need a specific type of charcoal that is more like a paste or thick liquid."

2016-04-11,The_Coati_Kid,news,21,n/a,"I do a lot of analytical chemistry at work. The equipment needed to work at microgram accuracy vs milligram accuracy represents a *significant* increase in cost. The microbalance (accurate to 0.0001mg) is probably the most expensive piece of technology in my lab, and it can only weigh very, very small volumes. The pill presses and balances these backroom labs are using are probably not nearly that accurate. When the difference between an effective and lethal dose is a matter of less than 100μg, and that's inside the error of your equipment, bad shit is going to happen. That's why illicit fentanyl is considered so much more dangerous than other opiates. If your cheap Chinese, table top pill press is off by ±0.1mg and you are producing OxyContin or MDMA or something that is dosed in the 50-100mg range, probably no one would ever notice the variation. If you use the same press for fentanyl, you're talking about weak pills coming out next to possible ODs. Consider too that when they weigh out the bulk material, they are probably using large analytical balances that start to get untrustworthy below 0.001g and you start to compound the issue. Then consider that in a backroom set up they can probably only process relatively small batches at a time, and any mistakes are distributed across hundreds of pills instead of thousands, so even what would be decent quality control in a factory is much less effective because there's so much less room for error. 

The smaller the effective dose, and the smaller the absolute difference between effective and lethal dose, the smaller the error required to kill someone is. I doubt the people in the labs are *that* good. It's inevitable that clandestine fentanyl labs will produce a batch that causes a bunch of ODs. Humans make mistakes, and equipment gets out of spec and needs to be recalibrated. And I doubt these labs are having the recalibration guy come do it. The microbalance I referenced above has to be recalibrated anytime it moves. Moved it from the basement to a 3rd floor lab earlier this year and it was worthless for a week until the technician came. 

So you're technically right that professionally produced fentanyl is no more dangerous than professionally produced heroin, morphine, or Oxy to the informed user. The problem is that this fentanyl is not being professionally produced, and a lot of users are not bright people, or under the impression they have bought legitimate pills when they haven't. I don't think anybody actually thinks it's really, truly more dangerous *per se*. It's the manufacturing and mislabeling that makes it dangerous, and that's what the article is about."

2016-04-11,MrPBH,medicine,59,n/a,"Okay, I'll chime in.  As an EM physician, I prescribe more narcotic scripts than most.

In the ED, IV narcotics are sometimes the only means of analgesia for many patients.  Abdominal pain patients need to stay NPO and if there is some concern for a surgical emergency, they really should not have NSAIDs, which impair platelet response.  Therefore, morphine or hydromorphone are the main stays of treatment.

For IV narcotics are also indicated for acute, severe pain such as long bone fractures and other trauma.  Chest pain patients also receive narcotics, since NSAIDs (with the exception of naproxyn) are proven to worsen outcomes in acute MIs.  Sometimes nitroglycerin isn't enough, and the only real treatment for a NTG-headache is morphine IV.

As to the morphine v hydromorphone angle, I find that morphine is longer lasting but has a ""dirtier"" side effect profile compared to hydromorphone.  By that, I mean that more patients complain of nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash with morphine compared to hydromorphone.  Morphine also causes more hypotension compared to hydromorphone, although hydromorphone is associated with more episodes of apnea.  More and more, I find myself using hydromorphone in place of morphine, as more patients tolerate it.  Nurses are also more willing to give 1 mg hydromorphone rather than an equivalent amount of morphine (8-10 mg); therefore, it's easier to give patients an appropriate sized dose of hydromorphone.

Fentanyl is an excellent drug but it has some specific shortcomings.  For quick procedures with a limited period of pain (central lines, dialysis catheter insertion, chest tubes, I&D) fentanyl provides good analgesia during the procedure without a prolonged period of sedation afterwards (as it has a half life of about 10-15 mins and an effective duration of 20-30 min).  Fentanyl is also an anxiolytic and helps me avoid having to provide full procedural sedation for otherwise quick and straightforward procedures because it calms patients.  It also is very useful in critically ill patients because it has minimal effects on blood pressure and hemodynamics since it does not cause the release of histamine like natural and semi-synthetic opioids.  Unfortunately, fentanyl makes a poor analgesic for somatic pain as its duration of action is very short, which requires frequent redosing; where I work, the nurses are spread so thin that patients are lucky to get redosed every three hours--giving a med every 30-45 min would be impossible. 

For outpatient narcotic analgesia, I only prescribe to patients that have an obvious source of acute pain that I know is self-limited in nature.  Broken bones, abscesses, extensive soft-tissue trauma, cellulitis in tender areas, corneal abrasions, bad pulpitis of molars, renal stones, and sometimes even severe sore throats (aka mononucleosis) are examples of such painful conditions.  There are two major outpatient oral narcotics, hydrocodone and oxycodone.  I don't mess around with any others such as hydromorphone, oxymorphone, or fentanyl patches as all of these products are commonly abused by IV administration, which I see almost everyday in the ED.  I don't like prescribing acetaminophen combo pills as it makes it too easy for patients to accidentally overdose on tylenol, so I primarily prescribe plain oxycodone, since hydrocodone only comes in combination products.  Some practitioners have taken to prescribing morphine tablets because it has less abuse potential than oxycodone, but from what I understand, fewer pharmacies stock morphine IR compared to oxycodone IR so I'm sticking with my tried and true.

EDIT: Codeine is the worst opioid available.  It has been shown to be no more effective than tylenol or motrin alone, but it has the worst GI side effects of any opioid (nausea, vomiting, constipation) and the same incidence of dermatological side effects (itching, rash).  A large proportion of the population lack the gene to metabolize codeine into its active form, morphine, and therefore recieve little to no benefit from the drug.  Conversely, a small fraction of the population are super metabolizers and some children with this trait can make enough morphine to overdose and die.  There are even case reports of nursing mothers who were taking codeine, happened to be super-metabolizers, and passed a large dose of morphine to their infants through their breast milk; the infants in these cases died of respiratory arrest from morphine overdose.   If the FDA were to review codeine today, it would never be approved for use; its availability is largely the result of historical precedence."

There's another medication for chronic pain (fentanyl) that comes in a ""lollipop"" form that can cause tooth decay because of the sugars in it. It's transdermal, because taking fentanyl orally isn't going to do much -- the bioavailability is pretty much shit. Hence the need for lollipops.

2016-04-14,CantBelieveItsButter,IAmA,7,n/a,"I have read the books, and no my reading comp isn't bad at all. Bandwagon's assertion is that GRRM and this Estonian's depictions of non-consensual sex with minors are comparable under the law and that GRRM should be persecuted because ""nobody forced him to write those scenes."" just like nobody forced this Estonian guy. You then showed up to support this guy's argument by confirming that yes, GRRM has in fact depicted some rape involving young girls in his books. What I'm talking about is that you're misleading people by ignoring the fact that the ACTUAL CONTENT of GRRM's scenes is not very graphic, and your use of the word 'brutally' is laughable. To be clear, Jeyne was probably brutally raped in the story, but nowhere in the actual text does it go into intense detail about it; the text sets up the beginning of the act and then ends the chapter. That's almost the very definition of a 'fade to black' device. Set up the scene, show where it's obviously going, and then fade out so you're not actually describing it and the viewer/reader can go ""yeah, ok it's obvious some bad shit happened to them sexually, but the details aren't important or necessary.""

I've gone and found the full PDF online, you can ctrl+f Jeyne like I did and look for yourself. The dogs are only mentioned, there is no act between her and dogs that's explicitly shown in the book. As for the rape scene with her on her wedding night with Ramsay, it is literally less than a page or two long and like I said the chapter ENDS at the beginning of the rape. Like, literally the last words of the chapter are about how Reek ""bent to his task"" of warming Jeyne up for Ramsay. Pretty brutal, right? It doesn't even detail the foreplay, so obviously it's on the same level as this Estonian's glorified snuff novella ^^/s . You seem to have an extremely low threshold for what qualifies as ""brutal."" 

I'd like to say that while the content of their works are related (i.e. they both have non-consensual sex regarding minors in them) the difference is night and day in the way it is approached and the way it is described. 

It's the same reason Lolita isn't banned either, the premise is taboo but the work doesn't go into lengthy detail because it obviously wasn't the objective of the book to excruciatingly detail child porn. This Estonian's novella is quite obviously made to do exactly that in order to shock the reader, and if you gave this book to 9/10 people I doubt they would take away the idea that the book was about the fentanyl problem in Estonia. I see no huge problem with the Estonian government taking action against it.


Edit: this isn't to say there is NO detail in GRRM's scenes, they obviously aren't intended to be read by super young kids, but the most detail he goes into is describing people naked for a few lines and people shoving their fingers into vaginas. It's probably the tamest description of a rape I could ever imagine, would you not agree?

Places like Estonia where heroin has all but disappeared have had HUGE INCREASES in deadly opiate OD's, almost all from Fentanyl.  why?  because it has twice the half life of heroin.  The ""high"" is over so the user takes more but feels little effect (because the fentanyl is still occupying the opiate receptors in the brain).  Regardless of the lack of feeling ""high"", your body still approaches toxicity (fentanyl also has a lower point of toxicity, i.e. it will kill with less drug).

This is part of why the drug war HAS TO END.  You want to save people, i get it.  But if the effect is the opposite of what you desire (protecting people's lives), you have to take a long hard look at what you are doing.  Sorry if that doesn't fit the ""bad mom, booo"" narrative.  Not excusing the mom, just pointing out the truth.

2016-04-21,Davidhaslhof,ems,12,n/a,"I'll be entirely honest.  Looking at resumes for flight paramedics I personally do not find big inner city EMS agencies very impressive.  Granted you might see ""good stuff"" but then again they usually have very short transport times and limited critical care transport experience.  So while they might see a lot they do not treat a lot.  

The things I like to see are LONG transport times and aggressive treatment and protocols.  Generally where I work that falls onto intercept paramedics.  

Some of the EMS agencies that get overly touted in my opinion are: 

Wake County:  I am friends with one of the medical directors and even he says their stats are slightly fudged.  They also tend think VERY highly of themselves(be humble people!).  Plus they can be pretty restricted (probably due to NC protocols)

LAFD:  I was planning to move out to LA until I found out they have to call for almost everything and they are very restricted.

King County: Having to call for EVERYTHING.  If you make me take a second paramedic class I shouldn't have to call to give some fentanyl.

There are SO many small paramedic agencies that are insanely progressive and yet I do not even know their names :(

Some agencies that stick out are:
San Juan Island EMS - Crazy transport times, very remote, and very progressive
Middlesex Hospital Paramedics:  While not as prestigious as they once were they are still pretty progressive

Instead of where the paramedic practiced I want to know his skill/knowledge level.  Some things are:

RSI - Knows when/how to use it
POCUS - Great assessment tool and ahead of the curve
Lots of ConEd

You can overdose off of 50-100mcg of fentanyl ... so assuming 100mcg of fentanyl to overdose and 1mcg of w-18 ... there's 1,000,000 overdoses in just a gram.

... or 4,000,000,000 ... 4 billion overdoses in 4-kilograms.  That's roughly 1000 overdoses for each person in alberta.

Really it is much more a chemical weapon than a drug.  It's dangerous enough that even with hazmat suits those that had to dispose of it likely were intoxicated ... or even at risk of overdosing.

2016-04-25,Kip_karo,changemyview,37,n/a,"I was a combat medic for an infantry battalion on a deployment to Afghanistan in 2013. We lost good men and I saw more people die than I ever want to again, so I have a pretty good grasp on this topic. I'll address your criteria in order.

1. If the soldier is alive, there is a chance to save him. It is only when obvious signs of death are present that we stop trying to save him. If his legs get blown off, we put tourniquets on the stumps. If he gets shot in he neck and the bullet tears up his throat and carotid artery, we stuff that artery with gauze and cut his throat open to intubate.  If his heart stops, we start doing chest compressions and we don't stop until either the heart recovers, the soldier is evacuated, or the body is warm and stiff. Considering that a normal evacuation would have the casualty inside an operating room within two hours, there are very few wounds that we won't try to treat.

2. We carry a lot of pain medications. In addition to over the counter stuff, I carried morphine, ketamine, and fentanyl, so pain can be treated. Besides, people don't want to die, and pain is worth it if there is a chance of survival, and if you're alive and conscious, there is a chance. So pain is always a good thing. It means you might not die.

3. If a soldier were ever injured badly enough that I couldn't even treat him (say, for example, he gets sliced in half at the waist), then he would be suffering from psychogenic and hemorrhagic shock, so he would likely have an altered mental status. I wouldn't trust a person with such injuries to give consent to stop treatment.

4. A combat medic always has his aid bag. If the worst were to happen and it were destroyed, I would still try to use everything I could to save the soldier's life. All soldiers carry a small pouch of medical equipment, and I cannot imagine a situation in which all of them would be destroyed. Even if they were, I would still use ripped up uniforms and sticks for tourniquets, plastic MRE bags for chest seals, pen tubes and a pocket knife for a cricothyroidotomy, and I would even stick a camelback hose up the casualty's ass to try to replace fluids if my IV equipment was gone.

Every time, though, I would stop before I injected the whole amount. I hated myself and what I'd done with my life, and it was torture to wake up every morning and realize I was still here. I wanted to die. I just couldn't bring myself to do it on purpose. I would just hope that maybe this batch was stronger than normal, or maybe it had some fentanyl in it or something, and I would just nod out and not ever wake up. But whenever I mixed up a fatal dose, I just couldn't do it. The thought of literally ending my being was just to much to process, I was legitimately terrified of what death would bring. As much as I didn't want to be alive, turns out I didn't exactly want to die, either. 

As an aside, I'll note that I've been sober for 3+ years and don't want to die anymore. Life actually got pretty rad.  "

2016-04-27,h4qq,islam,10,n/a,"I do not have a scholarly source to refer you to, but here are my two cents:

Just as we do it in the field or in hospital to determine an altered level of consciousness for patients, we ask baseline questions that any person should be capable of answering (what is your name, where are you, what year is it, etc.). Another example would be when police officers administer DUI tests to determine if someone is intoxicated. 

In this same line of understanding, we can say yes to every option you listed: 

- people can tell when they are not ""feeling right"", off balanced, dizzy, generalized weakness, euphoria, or the opposite of being in an excited state (and other symptoms that can be seen with use of uppers)

- a group of scholars could develop a baseline set of questions or standards (I do not know if this already exists or if it is even necessary)

- I guess we could say there is a social consensus when we realize ""odd behavior"" of an individual in public, ""hey that guy is acting weird"", but obviously that might not always be due to an intoxicant

- Scientifically, yes certainly, and I think that is the basis for it all when it comes to understanding how these intoxicants *intoxicate*. For example, if I use heroin it leads to it being deacetylated and then being bound to opioid receptor sites which illicits the response of systemic euphoria/pain relief. Same could be said about any other opiates (fentanyl being a major one that is up and coming), but I just used those as an example because it's more obvious. We could mention marajuana's mechanism of action too. 

- Common sense I think is a culmination of everything and just being generally aware and educated about these things. It's asking yourself ""if I do this, I have a good feeling this will happen"" and I really think this is what should be a first barrier against these things. I think everyone knows what it's like to *feel normal*, and we all understand what takes us away from that baseline.

2016-04-27,adhd_pharmd,pharmacy,15,n/a,"Will confirm this; the fentanyl in the news lately is street made; it is not pharmaceutical grade; lots of chatter on NPR about this in NH; it is said to be cheaper to produce than heroin. the news outlets cause a lot of confusion because they always attach a stock photo of pharmaceutical grade fentanyl to the story; this misleads the public because now everyone thinks it is being diverted or that the issue is with over-prescribing; not so

the recent surge in deaths is tied to street-produced fentanyl; our state medical examiner data has linked around 75% of overdose deaths to fentanyl alone or mixed with heroin; crunching down on pharmacies and doctors is going to have no effect; it will actually drive more people to seek street opiates and cause more deaths

I will say this, there will never be such a thing as a non-addictive effective pain med, because the brain has natural opiate receptors that opiod and synthetic opiods play off of. Its the natural chemical mechanism of the brain to relieve pain. Naloxone is also in response to Fentanyl being cut into Heroin to increase potency at a dramatically cheaper price. Fentanyl being used Intravenously is about as dangerous as can be. Mexican and South American Cartels have been cutting into their heroin with Fentanyl. These companies are trying to corner the market on something they know they can charge a hiked rate for. The reason only larger companies or heavy money backed smaller companies can produce this is because of its classification by the FDA as well as the amount of hoops they have to jump through to get it to market."

And again, Florida, being Florida, did absolutely nothing to support the vast community of addicts they created.  So a significant number of people turned to street drugs.  That's the first half of the problem.

The second half of the problem comes from the drug dealers who are cutting heroin with cheap Fentanyl -- or just mixing laxative powder and Fentanyl and selling it as heroin -- without paying attention to their measurements or mixing it thoroughly.

4. Why would someone mix spice with methadone instead of fentanyl if they wanted to fuck people over"
2016-05-01,jramd,AskDocs,9,n/a,"Pain is awfully difficult to manage - that is the first step in answering your question. Pain can be divided into acute and chronic pain. Generally, acute pain is self limited or has a treatable underlying cause. Chronic (>6 weeks) pain is often related to a) non-treatable underlying causes and b) pain related to neurological reorganization - the pain is a habit, a learned behavior that is difficult to break.

The second step is understanding how opioids work, while acknowledging that research is still ongoing. It is true that opioids help control pain. On top of this, they can cause sleepiness, euphoria and sometimes mild hallucinations. Also, extreme constipation. One key side effect is that in an overdose, opioids stop the brain from realizing it needs to breathe. This respiratory depression can cause death.

Unlike naproxen and Tylenol, opioids induce tolerance and dependence to themselves . Tolerance means that over time,  the same dose has less of an effect; or, to get the same effect, a greater dose is required. Dependence means the brain needs a given amount of opioid to feel 'normal.' When opioids are not taken, the person goes into withdrawal , a profoundly unpleasant state characterized by total body pain, sweats, shakes, vomiting and diarrhea. 

Opioids can be appropriate for acute pain because they are prescribed for such a short time course that tolerance and dependence do not develop, and they make life bearable while the problem is being resolved. 

Opioids can be dangerous in chronic pain because the pain has no predictable endpoint. This commits you and your doctor to an endless escalation of doses because of the phenomenon of tolerance. It also means you have to be kept with a steady supply of medication because of dependence. If circumstances prevent you getting your medication, you will be miserable. miserable people are often desperate.

That desperation can lead normally rational, dependable people to do ridiculous things - things they never thought possible. With a brain screaming for relief from withdrawal,  they will take any opioid, from any source,  to relieve it. This is the dangerous part,  because people seldom know how one opioid relates to another. Fentanyl is 100 times the potency of morphine, dilaudid is 5 times, and oxycodone is 1.5-2 times. It's easy to screw up, take too much, overdose and stop breathing. It happens and we deal with it in emergency departments every single day. People die from opioid overdoses every day, and it is often because they started into a cycle of dependence and tolerance from opioids prescribed for real pain. 

Added to this is the fact that chronic non-cancer pain is often poorly relieved by opioids. This pain is often caused by either peripheral nerves or central misprocessing of signals into pain. The effective treatments for the former are antiepileptics like gabapentin and pregabalin, as well as tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine and nortriptyline. The effective treatments for the latter are SNRIs like duloxetine, exercise and even cognitive behavioural therapy. In chronic pain treatment, we focus on function over pain - can you do the things that give your life meaning. Pain control is rarely 100%; most people over 40 live with some degree of pain. The use of an ineffective and potentially dangerous drug which requires ever-escalating doses, constant supervision and stunning amounts of constipation is the last resort for the treatment of chronic non cancer pain."

2016-05-02,NotABadDriver,videos,16,n/a,Last time I went under they used propofol and versed. My SO had fentanyl and versed. That's a pretty tiny sample size but it's better than nothing I guess?
2016-05-02,Immiscible,videos,37,n/a,"I used to work with anesthesiologists. A typical procedure uses versed before you go in, that makes the patients pretty loopy and they can say funny things pretty routinely. You can give fentanyl as a pre-medication too. That also makes patients loopy. 

When you get into the OR we usually pump you full of propofol which is what induces the coma. Next, we'll give vecuronium or rocuronium to prevent your muscles from moving. That's the typical cocktail, but obviously can change. I'd say that a case without propofol is atypical. That's pretty common. Afterwords patients say some very strange things coming off of the propofol. Usually it just isn't recorded because, well, it's an atypical reaction to medication and seems strange to record someone that's medically sedated for entertainment.

If you have inhalation based anesthesia I think sevoflurane is used the most. "
2016-05-02,PDX_bukkakanist,Drugs,8,n/a,"Codeine- the lamest pharmaceutical opiate. It is generally just itchy and not very enjoyable, but rappers love their 'syrup sprite'. 

Hydrocodone- It is a prodrug that is metabolized into hydromorphone by your liver and is the first stepping stone into quality pharmaceutical opiates. In the USA it is usually only available in formulations that also contain acetaminophen (aside from Zohydro) so you really quickly top out what you can safely consume daily without using too much Tylenol and fucking your liver up.

Oxycodone- Very euphoric high. Decent duration of 4-6 hours before effect drop off. 5-10mg is usually enough to get a naive person into a food space. Doing a 30mg pill for a beginner is not a good idea. Highly addictive. More of a stimulating and lively high that most other opiates.

Morphine- It's the original to which all other opiates are compared. It is usually fairly itchy, fairly sedating, and mildly euphoric. Quite good for actual pain relief. Not a great recreational pill IMHO...but some people love it.

Hydromorphone- This is the crack of opiates. It has a very nice blissful glow to the high, and according to IV users....it's the bombest rush of them all. It just lasts like 2-3 hours and you feel like you want more. 

Oxymorphone- This shit is simply amazing. It is better than heroin. It has the perfect balance of euphoric bliss and analgesia. They feel so nice that it is really easy to overdo it. Too many lines of OxyM and you are barfing incoherent mess...butbif you hit the sweet spot; it's like getting a blowjob from Gods wife (or maybe God herself).

Methadone- Yuk. Just Yuk. Tastes terrible. The high is lacking. It's great for pain relief. It's just not preferred by many in the opiate community because it blocks the better drugs from working for 24-36 hours.

Bupenorphine- See methadone. I'd rather go without opiates than touch this crap.

Fentanyl- Fuck fent. I mean...its a great drug for pain relief, but recreational use is just too risky for most people who have a real habit. The line you walk between pleasantly high and totally dead is thin. Their really isn't much euphoria to it for me....its just a bit of a glow and then you zonk out.

Heroin- I am in the West so we get 99% tar. I hate smoking heroin and I don't use needles. The high is great for the price. The analgesia is amazing. The taste is terrible. I have also had East coast powder a few times and that shit would be my daily dope if it were steadily available here. The price of #4 is way lower than blues (30mg oxys/my favorites) and the high is superior to tar in my opinion.

Poppy Seed/Pod Tea- Low grade version of the morphine experience because it contains morphine/thebaine/codeine and a host of other compounds. The duration of the experience is quite long....so is the withdrawal if you get a habit going.

Kratom-  The safest and most benign opiod option. If you are a newbie and want to see if opis are your style....I always recommend kratom. It's nearly impossible to OD on it unless you couple it with other drugs in unsafe amounts. It is legal so you don't have to get into any shady shit to try it. 

That is the extent of my opiate/opiod experience. I hope you can take something from it. Just remember that its a long road back once addiction grabs ahold."

In this case with a patient that has an addiction to opiates I would have chosen different drug classes because giving fentanyl to this patient wouldn't relief pain the same way.  It would be like pissing in the wind.  When I do these cases I use drugs like ketamine, which has a great analgesic component.  I would have probably still given fentanyl or sufentanil, which is much more potent, but not expected it to take care of the pain. If this were my case I would have first looked at doing regional anesthesia if possible.  It would depend on where the abscess was located.  If regional weren't an option I would have done general anesthesia or heavy sedation.  I would approach pain control with ketamine 50-100mg after a good dose of versed was on board.  Toradol might have helped some.  I wouldn't get too complicated because this is a quick and simple procedure.  If it were a larger surgery I would have considered using more drugs such as a magnesium, ketamine, gabapentin, clonidine or
dexmedetomidine for an alpha-2 agonist, and possibly a lidocaine drip.  Also of note the abscess that this patient has is probably the result of injecting or skin popping.

2016-05-04,ajh1717,Futurology,8,n/a,"Yeah, bullshit. I work in an ICU and have been part of a fair share of organ donations. What youre describing is essentially kidnapping by locking someone in a room.

Also there is no ""lethal injection"". In organ donations the patient is either declared brain dead, or is not fully brain dead but will not recover to anything other than being in a coma. With the first situation the organs are taken and then the patient is extubated and passes. In the 2nd case the person is extubated, passes, and then the organs are taken.

There is no ""lethal injection"" to kill someone. The only thing they might give is some morphine or fentanyl to make sure there is no chance the patient feels any pain. That is going to change the outcome. The patient is still going to die. So you can either give the pain meds to make sure they pass comfortably, or not and they potentially suffer.

2016-05-04,downwithship,explainlikeimfive,20,n/a,"General anesthesia uses a variety of drugs to cause unconscious. They all take advantage of receptors already in your brain (primarily GABA receptor) to achieve this. When GABA is activated it inhibits and slows brain transmission eventually resulting in unconciousness. Even with unconscious your body will still have a response to pain( increased hr, bp and reflex movement) so to controller these we give opioids such as fentanyl to block pain transmission, and muscle relaxants to prevent movement. 


Spinal anesthesia uses the injection of local anesthetic ( think novacaine for your teeth) near the spine to block transmission of pain signals. So even though your body is reporting pain the brain never receives it.


Local anesthesia is the same type of numbing medicine as the spinal, but is injected directly into the area that they are working on."

It took my entire lifetime pretty much, and lots of horrible arguments happened along the way, but in the end my parent is no longer a JW nor do they affiliate with them in any way despite the JW's hardest efforts to bring them back in to their cult (I think our doorbell has a groove in it from their use alone). I protested ""being"" a JW my entire life because when I was young (0-15) I had no choice but to follow my parent to the church services three times a week (called kingdom hall), which I protested every time by questioning how a god could even exist, and in the very remote chance he does exist how do we know we are worshiping the right one? Why isn't allah the right choice? If allah isn't the right choice, then an entire portion of the world is damned almost entirely because of where they were born. All these arguments just made my parent angry, but I had to at least make my opinion known. In the end though, the internet is what made my parent finally decide that they had been duped and were part of a cult for 2/3rd's of their life. The JWs had predicted the end of the world so many times and each time they were wrong they would put their own spin on why it didn't happen because of new information (which they called ""new light"" lol!!) and there would be a new prediction for the end of the world or finally after their last failed prediction, they just threw out a rough estimation of when the world would end and they called it ""the last days"", which we are now apparently a part of. 


My parent was able to go online at their own volition to research all of these failed predictions and also research the JW's dealings with the UN despite demonizing them as if they were an actual tool of satan. All of the information regarding the UN and JWs dealings were reported exactly the same everywhere except by the JWs themselves. All of this plus the JWs actively urging my parent to divorce my other parent because they were a bad influence finally made my parent decide that they were done for good with the JWs (to the joy and relief of the rest of the family).
 

I can't lie, the JW stuff really fucked up my life. I had zero friends in school because my devout JW parent would come in on the first day of school every year (until high school) and hand my teacher a list of things I cannot participate in (singing national anthem, Remembrance day ceremony, halloween activities, christmas activities, easter activities, sex ed) along with JW magazines about the supposed ""downfalls and bad influences"" that JW kids face in school. Other kids would of course see my parent doing this and I was always immediately humiliated for it. I of course had absolutely ZERO friends until I was 16ish and I met people that didn't know I was supposedly a JW (despite telling everyone I didn't believe in it around age 10-11 and up, I was still labeled a JW, bullied and laughed at). I'm positive that my upbringing and experiences with life from 0-15/16 made me develop the mental illness I suffer from today. 



I developed a full blown addiction to opiate based painkillers by the age of 17, which continued until I switched to heroin around age 24-25. I would just snort a few lines in the morning, afternoon and a nightcap, but after doing that for a year or so, I was injecting a shot of heroin every morning, noon and night. I eventually was shooting heroin all day long and I blew every single dollar I earned working on heroin. I suffered through major heroin withdrawal a few times because I was broke and too chicken to steal, so I switched from heroin to powdered fentanyl, which is dirt cheap online. I used the fenanyl for just under a year and during that time I just about killed myself 15ish times because a normal dose for me was a small pile of powder about half the size of a match head. I would try and get a little extra high and make a shot up about the size 3/4s of a match head, but I'd inject the shot, enjoy that blissful rush, then wakeup 90mins later on the floor in an awkward ball with the needle still hanging out of my arm. When I would pull the needle out, blood would shoot out of the hole with some serious force. That arm would also be completely numb and unusable for at least a couple hours. I eventually had to get myself on a methadone program, which has been a godsend despite the stigma I know face for using it. I have zero doubts that I would be dead if I didn't start the program when I did. 


Although I was clean from all drugs except for methadone (which just left me feeling normal, like I felt when I was 15 before ever trying opiates) I still was suffering from mental problems. I would worry constantly in all situations, and trying to walk around in a crowded store would just about guarantee a panic attack. I started to isolate myself to try and stop the worrying, but it just helped ease the social anxiety. I became so isolated that I got morbidly depressed, incredibly anxious at all times and I was an extreme insomniac. I had to stay in the pysch ward 3 separate times in an effort to keep from hanging myself and try to improve my mental health in the long run. I found getting on the right medication was more then half the battle. My final stay in the pysch ward, which was also the longest, seems to have done the trick in terms of getting me on the proper medication. I take my pregabalin and valium 3 times a day and a zopiclone before bed, which somehow turns me into a normal. I've actually made some new friends, had a girl ask me out and other incredible things life has to offer, which I otherwise never would have been able to participate in... Sorry this post got so long, but this cartoon really struck a nerve in me. Imagine if some kid went to school and started telling his friends about how to make jehovah happy? That kid will surely have no friends and he will become the target of jokes/bullying for the entirety of his life at school. I can testify that it really fucks a kid up to be in that cult. 

TL;DR Had a parent who was a JW who forcefully raised us as one also. I tried my best to provide information on why this was a man made cult. My parent finally does their own research and comes to the same conclusion as the rest of the family. The damage had already been done to me though, being raised a JW has numerous social downsides and I experienced them all full force ( I also have to take responsibility for not handling it well). "

2016-05-05,AAnnAArchy,kratom,6,n/a,"About two years ago I asked my roommate to call 9-1-1 because I was having very painful heart palpitations, which I had never had before.  Not only was it painful, it was scary.  My EKGs were fine, but the palpitations continued for almost a week.  I was switching from MS Contin to Fentanyl patches at the time, and because people who work for insurance companies don't care whether or not I end up in severe withdrawal, they didn't give the prior authorization for several days of the higher dose of fentanyl that I needed.  (I didn't know about kratom at the time)    

I was in withdrawal from switching from 200mg of morphine to 12.5mcg of fentanyl, and even though my doctor's office tried their best, the insurance company let me suffer for several days before approving my 50mcg dose.  Because they dragged their feet, my first 50mcg patch came from the emergency room. 

To deal with the diarrhea from the withdrawal, I took loperamide.  I took more than the normal dose, but nothing crazy like in the article.  Until I saw an article a few weeks ago about loperamide causing heart problems, I had thought my issue was caused by withdrawal or dehydration from the withdrawal.   I guess I am very lucky it wasn't worse because apparently I ended taking a very bumpy and unpleasant ambulance ride three miles to the local hospital due to a bad reaction to a slightly more than average dose of Imodium. 

TLDR:  A high dose, but not a crazy high dose of Imodium (around 12mg every eight hours) caused me to have really bad heart palpitations (and vomiting) and earned me an ambulance ride (you would think an ambulance would ride smoothly...but definitely not!) to the hospital and 4-5 hours of negative EKGs before I was released.  The palpitations continued intermittently for a week.  Be careful and don't take any more than you need.

Ecigs have helped so many people quit smoking, and has created a knowledgeable community which cares for itself and its members.

The good news now is that the police cracked down on them, drove the price through the roof, so now everyone just gets addicted to cheap heroin and overdoses on the fentanyl cut shit.

They push it through the medical community and then crack down on it when SURPRISE people use.  It's like they're getting paid twice.  While me and every 3rd person my age where I live know where to get it and struggle daily not to cop.  

It truly is a life ruiner.  If i ever have to have surgery or have an accident then i'm fucked because there's no way they will prescribe me enough for my tolerance and if they did then i'd be immediately hooked again.

The fundamental problem is that a patentable drug must be brand new, never before seen. Your body will have never been exposed to it, ever. You did not get sick because of the lack of those drugs in your system. Why would we believe that they can fix your bodies ailments?

But if the doctor writes a script for enough to put a heroin addict to sleep for everyone that's also a shitty doctor.

u-47700 is perhaps the most dangerous RC out there, and probably the second most dangerous opioid out there right now second to only fentanyl and its derivatives. That would be like going from drinking a beer one night to chugging a bottle of Everclear the next, or taking a Norco one day and shooting dope the next.

Perhaps the worst thing about u4 is that it's new and unpredictable. Doesn't just come with the typical opiate effects and side effects. Go post on r/opiates if you're serious. They'll tell you all about how you'll wake up several times a night in horrible WD's, needing to do a line every hour or two just to sleep for a bit. Or how it'll burn a hole in your nose from snorting it and destroy your veins if you IV it. Or how you can take the same dose twice in a day and fall out the second time around. Or how if you mix it with almost anything else it becomes even more unpredictable and deadly. Or how it's not even fun and worth any of it because you get a rush for a half hour and then an insatiable craving for more, like it's crack cocaine, but your tolerance skyrockets within days and you're blowing lines of it around the clock until your nose starts bleeding.

2016-05-09,Shadowplay123,AskReddit,22,n/a,"So I work in the ER but we use the same drugs (smaller doses) in ""conscious sedation"" (like for reducing a broken bone) and I've rotated through anesthesia. 

There are three things that are involved in anesthesia:

Anesthesia - literally not remembering. This is the drugs like Propofol/inhaled anesthetics (Michael Jackson died on Propofol) that induces unconsciousness and makes you not remember the operation. You can still feel pain and not remember later which is why it's bad practice to just use anesthetic agents. 

Analgesia - pain control. This is drugs like morphine and fentanyl that are used to treat pain but typically are not used to induce coma (although you see there is some overlap - enough morphine and you will certainly obtain anesthesia). 

Paralytic - drugs called Rocuronium or Succinylcholine which literally just stop all your muscles from working. You're wide awake underneath it. 

What I've found is that when patients are afraid of being ""awake"" they're afraid of being paralyzed and unable to communicate, without benefit of anesthesia or analgesia. Practically what the anesthesiologist dose is estimate the doses of all the drugs that you will need, and then adjust based on various factors. OR get complicated and need more time? Repeat doses. Patient having BP spikes or heartrate rising? They're feeling pain or the sedation is too light, increase the dose. Many patients aren't even paralyzed during their operations, just on the other two meds. 

The diligence of anesthesia is watching for the signs, and catching them long before there's issue or awareness to the patient. "
2016-05-09,Hard_Avid_Sir,Foodforthought,29,n/a,"While I'm not saying that anyone should go out and start shooting heroin, that's not actually how it works. 

Most overdoses happen when someone relapses or when someone starts selling especially pure heroin. Yeah, addicts tend to up their dose as they go, but they do so because they've built up tolerance, which is exactly why that gradual increase isn't (usually) what kills them. 

No, the dangerous times for addicts are when their intuitive knowledge of their limits fails to line up with what they're using. Someone who's used to heavily cut, low quality heroin who suddenly 'lucks' into something much stronger who does their 'usual dose' and is caught unaware by the potency. Someone who's managed to stay clean for long enough for their physical tolerance to have dropped and injects the same dose they were fine with before when they relapse. Someone who thinks they've bought heroin and actually gets fentanyl or some shit. 

Funny thing about all this stuff though, you may even have noticed. A lot of this wouldn't happen in a regulated environment. If you buy a bottle of booze marked 80 proof it's not going to actually be 160 proof (or 40 proof). If your doctor prescribes a drug for you, it's going to have the exact amount of 'active ingredient' it says it does on the label. 

If you want people to stop dying of heroin then, as paradoxical as it may sound, the best solution might just be to give it to them, but at a known strength and purity and to provide them with a safe place to shoot it and help quitting if they'll take it.

2016-05-11,orangesunshine,opiates,18,n/a,"Hi,

First you are in a position where you don't need to worry about getting street heroin.  As a patient suffering from pancreatic cancer (one of the most painful diseases known to man ... sorry :(  ... you will have access to any opiate you want.  Dillaudid, morphine, fentanyl, or opana ... your doctors will have *no* problem offering them up.  In addition to your cancer specialists, you should be set up with a doctor who specializes in something called ""palliative care"".  They concentrate on making you comfortable ... free of pain with opiates ... and free of anxiety and depression.

You shouldn't let yourself believe things are hopeless quite so quickly though.  Find yourself a research hospital ... and a doctor who specializes in pancreatic cancer ... and see what *he* has to say about your options.

My brother had a really rare type of leukemia and sought out the best doctors in the country.  He quickly went from doctors that told him he was likely to die, to doctors that were confident they could not only treat the leukemia ... but if one of his family members was compatible they could *cure* it within the next 6-12 months.

Anyways it's ~4 years later and he's not dead ... and no longer has leukemia.  He's not even taking any of the transplant drugs since everything went so smoothly ... and my bone marrow seems to work super good.

You need to immediately start looking for the best hospital in the country to handle the disease you have.  If there is a clinic near you associated with Mayo, you should see one of their specialists ... and ask him if he was sick where would he go?

This is obviously time sensitive, so make sure you aren't waiting 2-3months for an appointment just to ask a question about where you should go .. or what have-you.  Within the next 1-2 weeks, you need to be getting ready to get on an airplane and see who you need to see.

There's usually free housing near these major teaching/research hospitals.  So your family should be able to stay near by for free if they need to.

You really need to find a research hospital though.  There are often treatments and even cures that you'll have access to at a major research hospital ... specializing in cancers .. pancreatic cancers."

The poor guy probably had zero opiate tolerance and could have taken a whole opana or dilaudid or a number of other things. You don't have to use a freaking bazooka to kill yourself. He only described opiate overdose, and you all immediately assumed it's the strongest opiate on the market—the one that can take out an experienced junkie.

2016-05-11,johntheswan,Drugs,7,n/a,"There are **absolutely** other opiates out there besides fentanyl or suboxone that could be lethal after ingesting a single pill... Larger doses of MS contin come in pills ranging from 60mg to 200mg at the upper limit. These are similarly meant to be diluted. One of the first opiates I ever got my hands on was a 100mg MSC, and was told explicity to only use 1 quarter of it, lest I overdose. Opana (oxymorohone) is a super popular drug—the DOC for a lot of my old opiate head friends—with a very narrow dosing range. Those bad boys, while normally coming in 10 mg doses (which I honestly think can kill the uninitiated), have an upper single-pill dose limit of 40 mg that, you guessed it, will kill ANYBODY with no history of opiate use if they ingest it all at once. I could keep going, but I don't think it's necessary. 

I'm not suggesting that fentanyl isn't super cheap. Or that it's impossible that it was pellet meant to be diluted and dosed volumetrically or something (which is what I think you're implying... and also kinda a stretch of the imagination) Just that it's highly unlikely, because there are perfectly mass produced pills on the market that can kill you with a single administration; one pill. 

We don't know the whole story, which is **really** important here. For example, if OP's friend was drinking alcohol (even as few as &lt; 3 drinks) while being completely opiate naïve, do you really think that it would require a heroic dose of fentanyl to render the user unconscious and not breathing? Beyond that: How much did OP's friend weigh? Was OP's friend sick at the time? Did OP's friend lose a lot of weight recently?

 I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here, I abused these things for a long time in my past and know that everybody is different and reacts differently -sometimes lethally- to these drugs. I've had opiate experienced friends nearly asphyxiate and die off of 4mg of Dilaudid.

Less a question, and more a request. I'd like to see more stories (including this LA Times series) address the hazy line between street and pharmaceutical opioid abuse. Your average American has this disconnect where heroin and junkies are seen as one thing and prescription pain medication another. It does a disservice and stifles meaningful conversation about the dangers of a culture so conditioned to take prescription pain pills. I think if people were made more aware that heroin and oxycodone (et al.) are essentially one in the same, their views on our nation's pharmaceutical dependency might change. 


It's unfortunate, but I wonder if the spike in accidental deaths from Fentanyl might be helping to that end. The idea that a drug as ""dangerous"" as heroin is being laced with a pharmaceutical may be shaking up people's notions of which is worse. 


I'd love to see you discuss that blurry line as it relates to OxyContin, given that this particular medication was-- speaking from personal experience-- an exponential leap forward in turning casual pill poppers into lifeless junkies.


Regarding how a culture of pharmaceutical complacency can create extreme addicts: To those interested, I highly recommend the documentary [Oxyana](http://oxyana.com/). It's about a town in West Virginia conditioned by generations of coal mine culture to take whatever pain meds the company doctor gave them. They weren't the healthiest or without substance abuse problems, but you can only abuse Vicodin so much... One day Oxycontin showed up and the entire town, accustomed to less powerful opioids, became deeply addicted. It's a pervasive problem, but this one look at one region is totally eye opening. 


Thank you for the investigation and write-up. As someone who lost nearly a decade to an opioid addiction that started with a Percocet prescription and was catapulted into the stratosphere (and heroin) by OxyContin, it's enlightening to hear a new facet of our institutional opioid epidemic and the deeply entrenched pharmaceutical giants who perpetuate it. 

But mostly I'm just happy to see people talking about it. "

I was on Oxy before my back surgery and it really helped. I was in a LOT of pain for 2 years. Took the max dose and my pain specialist doctor prescribed every 8 hours.  I had to go once every 3 weeks to get a new scrip because he couldn't call them in and he made me piss in a cup to make sure I wasn't 'diverting'.  (Also we tried the Fentanyl patch and Kadian but they didn't seem to get to the pain as well as Oxy.) 

I could still mildly  feel the pain underneath and I was miserable all the time but it would have been really bad without it. (In fact I probably would have used really drastic measures to end the pain. I'd heard of people who killed themselves because the pain got too much and that freaked me out.) After my surgery my doc weaned me off and I have no desire ever to do Oxy again. 

Edit: on the downside a few times I ran out completely because it's such a pain in the ass to get a script I went through withdrawals and imagined robbing a pharmacy at gunpoint.

An individual doesn't need to go through the DEA when purchasing a pill press in Canada! That's why all the best darknet Xanax bar vendors are Canadian. 

And before you freak out, these bars are actual alprazolam, tested many many times by simple at-home reagent tests, and sent to places like ecstacydata or EnergyControl.


Also, there are a decent amount ""chemists gone rogue"" up there, due to there being easy-to-get pill presses. This creates a demand for these chemists. I know at least one of the biggest Xanax bar pressers has their own chemist synthesizing their alprazolam powder, rather than sourcing it via China. 


One of these chemists trying to get rich will also synth fentanyl for the right price.

It looks like a total case of fentanyl od. When I was using, my dealer for a while had a batch that I could tell there was no H in it. One way I could tell the difference. Every single time I shot up I would ""go out"" and before I realized what was going on I continued to buy more of the same batch. At first I thought it was super strong H. But the more I read about it the easier it was to figure out it was fentanyl. Fentanyl had very small or I would say no euphoria with the rush and then later on when I copped from another source you could totally tell the difference. Also when I am doing heroin unless Im mixing narcotics I rarely ""go out."" When ever I did the alleged fentanyl, I would go out every time, about 2-3 mins after I dose.

You can find a good number of threads if you use the search function, and [this tread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/4i1hai/i_often_read_that_the_judicial_system_is_weighted/) which didn't) which didn't come up in the search has some interesting articles linked in it.

That said, I think the idea of a ""pussy pass"" as used on reddit is the idea that women can get away with anything, and the implication of all of the articles posted is that a man would have received a much harsher punishment. I don't think that is justified. I only read a few articles, but in a couple of cases it seemed like reasonable sentences or leniency that would likely have been extended to a similarly situated man. For example, why should a person who masturbates in public be sent to jail? Rehab and probation seem like the correct punishment in that case. I also don't know that a man wouldn't have received the same sentence - for example [man serves one day in jail for masturbating in public](http://m.mykawartha.com/news-story/4338474-man-serves-one-day-in-jail-for-masturbating-in-public). The woman out on porole for stealing fentanyl is another example. She has a plee deal for testifying against her boyfriend, who appears to have been finding clients to sell to, which seems like a common tactic regardless of gender. They make a good point in the article that minor drug dealers who are also users are treated more harshly, but that could just as easily be a class, race, and prejudice against users issue as a gender issue. The most glaring article I read was about the teacher sentenced yo five years probation for having sex with a student, which should have resulted in some jail time. It seems like in similar cases with male teachers, they receive at least a year.

Over all, I think that talking about the gender sentencing gap is a good thing, and we should examine whether the justice system is treating various groups unfairly. However, I think the focus should be on reducing sentences for men, rather than increasing sentence for women. I don't like the ""pussy pass"" concept or sub, though, because it seems like just another place for people to complain about women. I also think that a ""penis pass"" sub could easily be populated with similar articles of men let off easily. "

Last summer I was camping in a mountain. We were on property my two of my roommates used to live on. It burned to the ground after they moved out, and now people associated with it camp there. Anyways, it was my first time there and we were there for two days and then my roommate and I had to go pick up my other roommate (for context, both those roommates date and were the ones who used to live there, and one of them just got a job so had to take a bus up on the weekend).

When we go to pick my other roommate up, google directions to the bus station an hour away said to take a right off the property. Now, for the first two days, to get to town and get food/beer, we went left. So I go right as the directions say. Keep in mind it is my first time up here and have never gone right. As we go along, I'm driving in a Nissan Altima, the road starts getting worse. Pot holes, cliffs to the side. ""Are you sure this is the way to go?"" I say. ""Yea sure, we used to drive this way all the time."" (hindsight: in *what* vehicle?).

Anyways, we finally decide to turn around but can't do it until we find a clearing ahead giving me enough room. Once we get to a clearing, there are 4 people on ATV's just chilling. Thank GOD for them. They give us the ""Dude, what the hell? Take that car and go the other way!"" look and I lower my head a little, ashamed I've driven this far and trusted my roommate. We turn around.

30 seconds later, I can see a pothole coming and I swerve to the left. Too late, got stuck right in it. I get out of my car and just I take a step out of it the ground disappears on me and suddenly I'm knee deep in water and have no idea how far I have fallen. I quickly assess myself. I look up, and there is my car a few feet ahead of me. I yell out to my roommate whom I can't see, ""I think I broke my arm!"" I wasn't quite sure yet. I go to stand up, and feel a sheering pain run through my forearm. Every part of my body but my forearm stood up with me. That's when the pain kicked in. I didn't actually feel the break.

By this point the people on the ATV's, who knew we were idiots, showed up figuring something would probably go wrong. They try and call 911 but no service. Two of them race down the mountain to call 911. I'm freaking out, did I just lose an arm? Shit shit! I play guitar fuck that shit! I look up back at the car and it now feels a lot more looming. The front wheel is a little over the edge am I going to die? I guess I'm in enough pain I won't feel being crushed. Then I notice, something actually settling. I don't see blood or bone. Holy shit! This might be alright after all! 

All this is happening really quickly. One of the ATV dudes climbed down and gave me water in the meantime. Literally fed it to me. My roommate has a bad knee, who knows what she would have done if they weren't there. So now I'm feeling a bit more reasonable. I need to get out of this river, if that's what you'd call it. But even minute movement sends sheering pain through my arm. ATV dude needs to come back down and gently pull the brush caught between my arm and body away from me. With a quick bout of confidence and trying to forget my pain, I jump to my feet, nearly drop my forearm and catch it. Now I'm standing in the river, holding my arm. But at least I am free. Now, how do I get back up? The ATV dude led me to the shortest part of the bank and up the gentlest slope to the road. 

The ATV guys were definitely prepped. They got my car out of the pot hole. I got in my passenger seat and one of them drove my car until we got to a fork, because obviously the ambulance wasn't coming from the direction we turned around from, and waited for it. It finally showed up and 2 hospitals and lots and lots of fentanyl later, I had surgery that night. Arm saved!

2016-05-16,fruitsforhire,todayilearned,11,n/a,"Part of the issue is that opioids are for medical use only, and the people who get addicted to them eventually run out of money due to their very high cost or are cut off from access by their doctors. They then turn to heroin as access to safer medical opioids is gone for them. It's a difficult situation all around. Society is attempting to crack down on medical opioid access, but it's doing more harm than good in the short-term as it pushes people to illegal heroin and fentanyl which are a lot more dangerous. Long-term projections on the outcome of the crackdown are unknown. 

I personally think this is going to be a serious problem for at least another 10 years.

There are plenty of docs that summarily cut off a patient or lower their dose once they reach a certain dose, and that's mostly to cover the doc's ass.  Does not seem to matter if its really helping the patient. Of course, if the doc truly and legit believes that the patient is ready to come down on their dose, then that decision makes sense, but we've all heard so many stories of docs just freaking out once their patient is at a certain level.

#warning, wall of text incoming.

This is the longest post I have ever posted on reddit. I can chime in here. Big time.

I have chronic back pain. I broke my back a few years ago. A very, very bad break involving a crushed spine (Also broke it again a few weeks ago yay fml). 

I cannot believe I am actually saying this, like it pains me to say this, but he is right in that aspect. I went to one of the most expensive, successful, and world renowned chronic pain rehab centers in the entire nation. It was connected to the regular portion of a regular top drug rehab centers in the entire nation. 

I'm an alcoholic. I rarely drink anymore though, but that was my reasoning to go there. I was in severe chronic pain and surgery was completely out of the question. Our nation is in a VERY bad opiate epidemic. I don't even need to post sources, just Google it and it will be right there. It is a huge proven fact and it is a very serious epidemic.

Everyone in our ""chronic pain unit"" was in there for horrible chronic pain and 90% were addicted to pills (I'm talking 40-60 hydrocodone a day) and the rest of us were in there for alcohol. My drinking got worse because I couldn't find a pain doctor for shit because of the new laws to combat this epidemic. Pill mill doctors are a cancer in our society. 

I was in there for a month. Every day we learned about healthy eating habits, sleep habits, meditation, yoga, acupuncture, chiropractors, the bad effects of drugs and shit (obviously), non-narcotic alternatives and other random things.

Chronic pain is *highly* related with drug addiction. I felt terrible for everyone in there. This one lady was on fentanyl patches for over a year. That is insane. She couldn't walk she became so weak. But she was in so much pain from cancer and broken bones and shit that she needed it at first. Over the weeks she ended up being able to walk because of the things we did in there. 

So, meditation wasn't my thing at all because I'm a 26 year old dude who just can't get into that kind of stuff because my mind is always all over the place. Yoga helps strengthen your body and is very relaxing although difficult as shit. Acupuncture is stupid to me but it does feel pretty good and for a lot of people *with chronic pain* a placebo effect is all they need because your mind controls pain. 

People give chiropractors a ton of shit and I used to also. I used to call them quacks. Well, *for people with chronic pain* it is a VERY healthy and safe alternative instead of getting hooked on opiates and leading down a path to destruction. Paying money to get some relief for X amount of time is better than swallowing pills all day.

I could honestly go on and on about this. For hours. I do *not* believe in alternative medicine to treat cancer and all of that bullshit so I am not some weird asshole in that way. I am *strictly talking about chronic pain and how certain alternative methods are infinitely better than popping pills all day.*

FML I cannot believe I just somewhat defended a Bernie statement but I had to because I actually live the life and became extremely educated over the past 2 years on chronic pain and opiate addiction so I felt like I had to say something.."
2016-05-19,hypnagogick,opiates,6,n/a,"I was diagnosed with a stage IV cancer almost two years ago (at 24 years old) and pretty much immediately became addicted to the opioids I was prescribed. For a while nobody could really tell and thought I was using everything responsibly. A few months into treatment I had a month long stay in the hospital where I was constantly getting IV Dilaudid, sublingual fentanyl and oxymorphone around the clock. After getting out my body was destroyed by the treatment so I actually needed constant large doses of opioids to feel ok. But within three months I had mostly recovered but decided not to give up my heavy use because I'd become severely depressed. 

This went on for a while and things got worse and worse as I also became briefly addicted to prescription Adderall and Xanax, damaging my relationships with friends, family and worst of all my fiancée. When I realized I was fighting with her over nothing all the time I knew it had to be my fault and quit Adderall and asked to not get another script, and tapered off benzos. I'm still getting chemo so I've been using that to justify continual opioid use, but the amount of fentanyl I go through in a day is just unreasonable considering my actual pain levels have gone done drastically due to being much healthier than I was when I started treatment.

I finally got IV ketamine treatment for my depression and half way through the treatment decided I was done with opioid addiction and wanted to taper off. Tomorrow I'm going to PM to ask for subs instead of my usual fentanyl and oxymorphone."

I did a narcan outreach project my senior nursing school year in an emergency department.

Most people who OD don't want to OD. They get a bad batch, or a batch tainted with something other than regular heroin. In Rhode Island a year ago it was the beginning of fentanyl laced heroin. Someone found a large shipment of fentanyl gel patches, they cooked the gel into a powder and then mixed it in the heroin. For those chasing the dragon, it was marketed as a more potent high. Well, yeah, transdermal meds injected IV will get you super high- or in most cases, dead.

The non script Narcan isn't targeted for the users. Its for the family and friends of users. The friends and family of users are the survivors after they OD and die. We have to think about them, not just the user. 

Narcan is a lifeline for when they do OD. Its a chance that allows family members to act (to reduce PTSD which has a large component of being helpless in an overwhelming situation) and it allows them buy breathing time until EMS arrives. Its not a license to be brave and OD as much as you want- how many people who OD can actually administer Narcan, u/smegma_in_my_teeth?

In any case, pharmacists MUST train the user who purchase it and are emphatic it buys time until EMS and definitive care and it will quickly wear off and not work.

On a final note, think about the brain dead ODs from oxygen starvation. If a 28 year old brain dead kid has no DNR and becomes vent dependent, how many hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on ventilation, on critical care medicine, on long term skilled nursing care? How much suffering from their families?

2016-05-21,headclone,boston,15,n/a,"Hello, medical student at BU currently working at BMC here. You bring up a couple common misconceptions about addiction treatment and based on your cordial tone I thought you'd like to hear from a medical perspective.

The reason methodone patients get methodone is because it keeps them from taking heroin. That's it. Medically, it is immensely preferable to have patients getting high on a consistent, regulated, arguably less addictive, and non-transferable drug than a baggie off the street. The baggie is supposed to have heroin, but in what quantity? What if there's fentanyl in there, which is found in something like 80% of the bags police pull from patients I've seen? What if there's something worse? Medically, the patient is much better off taking something WE give them rather than some drug dealer to hold off withdrawal.

The next step is addiction treatment. The sad thing about working at the hospital is seeing people who are systematically doomed. A common story: Pt gets brutally injured either in a personal or work accident and requires pain medication for a small period of time. They get a prescription opioid, ususally something comparatively weak. Eventually, they don't need it anymore, but they want it. They could have diagnostically addictive personalities, they could be homeless, they could live in a violent home, etc etc but they could very well also just be normal people. And now they're addicted.

Treating them, then, is a matter of convincing them to stop doing this thing that makes all the pain go away and make them feel absolutely amazing long enough that their bodies don't scream for it anymore. How do we do this? Well, we can wean them off using a regulated and titratable drug, like methodone (or, IMO better, suboxone). We can try to resolve the risk conditions for their addiction, some of which I listed above. New research that I'm participating in at MGH is trying to build a neural implant that can detect a ""craving"" and stimulate the brain so as to stop it (the project is much larger, and has the potential to therapeutically cure dozens and dozens of diseases, but that's another post.)

Addicts bullshit themselves and everyone else they know all the time, but I don't understand why he's bullshitting us, as there is no way we're going to improve our opinion.  He gets no advantage from telling us it's not that bad, except attempting to persuade himself.

It ain't how this works.  And, remember, he's not an addict, he's just a social user of heroin, and *doctors prescribe opioids*.  I have never known a social user of heroin, though I know plenty of people who have used it.  Once someone gets to heroin, it's because they can't afford to buy Percocet or Vicodin any longer and know they'll get a similar high.

Never mind that the shit you get on the street isn't FDA approved, and even if you trust your supplier, *he* gets it cut already, and the cuts can be unpredictable.  Here around Boston, a lot of heroin has been spiked with fentanyl lately, instead of the more standard and much cheaper fillers, and the ODs have skyrocketed.

2016-05-24,serohaze,Austin,8,n/a,"Yeah, definitely. For those unaware, Fentanyl is dosed in MICROGRAMS. That means it's dosage range is at the level of 1/100,000th of a gram. It's extremely hard to be accurate at a dosage level that small, and the drug will easily knock people on their ass. Especially if they're coming off a tolerance break and shoot up more than they are used to. 

For comparison, heroin is dosed in milligrams, which is 1/1000th of a gram. If you cut heroin with fentanyl or sell it as fentanyl and you're not careful, you could seriously kill someone. "
2016-05-24,rwritingaccount,writing,21,n/a,"Here's that post I was talking about. I wrote it up the last time I saw a question like this.

Warning: Longish post ahoy. 

I am an opiate/opioid addict and professional writer (freelance content, marketing stuff, etc.) who has been under Suboxone management for the better part of three years now. It's funny you asked this question at this time: My two shorts on Kindle were written during a **very** dark time in my life with regard to drug abuse, and one, Floodsick, is a story *about* addiction set in a horror story's framework. 

To answer your questions in order: 

1. Pills and heroin. A lot. Like hundreds of dollars a day worth. My current Suboxone scrip and monthly doctor's visit runs me closer to $450 a month, which is a phenomenal fucking savings compared to the old days. 

2. Because I needed - and still need, counting the Suboxone - them to do anything. Opiates/opioids fuck with your brain's reward center. When you're taking them, you're flooded with dopamine, and you're at your most creative - or, more likely, the critical voices in your brain shut the fuck up and let you explore this idea or write that sentence without stopping you. In that respect, they're very helpful. **BUT:** They're totally not worth the downtime or instability they cause when you aren't on. 

3. Feverish some days, forcing myself to sit at the desk others, not doing it at all others yet... addicts aren't known for their personal accountability or ability to do things they don't feel like doing at a consistent level. I would go through manic creation phases followed by periods of zero productivity. Even though I write daily now, my creative cycles still sort of mirror this. 

4. If you count Suboxone, yes. I haven't had an illegal drug since I started the program, and science willing I never will again. That said, if I had to quit Suboxone cold turkey, I would definitely not be able to write for a while because of the, you know, crippling withdrawal and all that. 

5. I don't know. I'd be lying if I said my work wasn't largely better when I was donked out on H/Fentanyl/Percocet all the damn time, but it came at a much slower rate, and I'm getting back up to a level of productivity that blows that out of the water while still maintaining 90% of the quality. That said, Floodsick is still the best short story I've ever written... having recently gotten back into the fiction game, though, I'm hoping I can achieve similar results there as I have with contents. 

Sorry for the novel. Topic near and dear to my heart and I really had to restrain myself to keep it this short. If you're a younger writer reading this: **DO NOT RELY ON DRUGS TO MAKE YOU PRODUCTIVE, CREATIVELY SPEAKING, AND DO NOT FALL INTO THE NEED-DRUGS-TO-WRITE TRAP.** Not to go all motivational-speaker on everyone, but I am like the dictionary entry on a promising young life fucked up by the poppy, and I hate myself for it as a person and as a creative professional every goddamn day. There isn't a trip to the doctor goes by that I don't think about crashing my car into something big for wasting all the money I have and hurting all the people I have - myself included in that statement. 

Fuck drugs, and especially opiates and opioids. A sincere thanks for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts and experience on this topic. "

However, what my people believe to be an allergic reaction to codeine (nausea/vomiting, hives/itching, headache) are actually just side effects of the drug working on other locations of the body. A true allergy to that class of drugs is possible, but rare. Other drugs in the class include oxycodone and hydrocodone as well as oxymorphone and hydromorphone. Methadone, tapentadol, and fentanyl are in a separate class of drugs that work on the opioid receptors and do not have concerns for cross reactivity.  "

2016-05-25,cleverlikeme,explainlikeimfive,26,n/a,"That's not strictly true. 

First, there is a concept called 'scope of practice' that is professionally evaluated. I can, as the pharmacist, professionally judge that a prescription is outside of a particular doctor's 'scope of practice' - doesn't happen often at all with regard to internal medicine / general practitioners, but it is worth considering.

Second, there are drugs that can *only* be prescribed by physicians with certain registrations or certifications. The two that come to mind are buprenorphine/naloxone combinations, and fentanyl lozenges (only the lozenges, not other forms). Both require physicians to be registered under separate specific programs.

Finally, there may be other things I'm not thinking of right this second. Point being, the law on who can prescribe what, even for MD's, is fairly complicated and intentionally vague - and then there is the law on what a pharmacist can or should fill, which adds yet another layer."
2016-05-25,cleverlikeme,explainlikeimfive,7,n/a,"Neither or both?

Technically, as far as I understand, and doctor can, as long as they register with the individual programs, complete the required additional education, and comply with the additional red tape and reporting requirements.

Typically, buprenorphine/naloxone is addiction specialist / pain management, whereas fentanyl lozenge is pain management / oncologist / neurologist

I'm not an MD, and my interaction with docs on this subject is along the lines of 'you can't prescribe this, you need to be registered with program xyz, call me back if that changes'"
2016-05-25,perogies,vancouver,9,n/a,"""I just think that safety for sick people should come first before aesthetic"".

- Sure in a lot of cases, but not in a Downtown public space that's enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people.  Why should we waste tons of taxpayer dollars to ruin a view that would potentially save less than one person life per year.  It's not fair to the rest of us.  How far can the public reasonably be expected to bend to cater to a tiny percentage of people?  How is it justifiable to spend millions of dollars building a fence to stop less than one person jumping off the Burrard Street Bridge per year?  How many people have overdosed on fentanyl this year for example?  Aren't they sick?  There are far more important things that money could be used for.  "
2016-05-25,j0bb1e,explainlikeimfive,6,n/a,"In the US fentanyl lozenges are usually only prescribed by pain management physicians (specialized anesthesiologists) who have completed an FDA-required program specifically for this medication. Oncologists can prescribe opiates, but since this particular one has much more specialized use, I'm fairly certain they just would let pain management deal with it. 

Buprenorphine/Naloxone (Subutex) is most commonly prescribed by addiction specialists, but can also be prescribed by GPs. Both of them have to complete a similar program and there is a limit (IIRC it's 200 patients) to how many people they can prescribe it to at once.  "

2016-05-27,CanadianChipper,opiates,6,n/a,"I think sometimes we forget that, just like us users get a bad rap because of a bad few, so do a lot of dealers. It's a job. Especially dial-a-dope dealers selling small amounts. Often they are good people trapped in a shitty situation. We are all just trying to survive. Shit, as users and dealers we have to do some really terrible shit sometimes. We see people at their worst. It feels damn good to help.

I am in Vancouver and I use a few different lines. We get great #4 heroin here. Almost all is sold via delivery. One line I have been using since I was 15. I am 20 now. Originally the dealer cut me off and tried to help me get on subs. After I overdosed on down possibly cut with fent, he reluctantly went back to selling to me. He is always on time as possible, polite, honest, never buffs his D and if its weaker he makes up for it with extra. Price is always consistent, $20 a point, $30 a quarter gram, $400 a ball. I am not physically dependent so i don't ever need fronts, but I know they are available. He tries to encourage me to meet my goals and to keep away from developing a habit. He always is concerned with my well being and I really barely know him. he often gives me little extra for no reason. Ive taken him for lunch and you know what? he cried. A grown man. He told me people never ask him how he is, never take any time to do anything but buy dope. He was grateful to have a friend who was curious about him. and to me, thats pretty damn sad.

I use another line where the approach is much the same, but only to keep customers. When you have as much competition as in Vancouver you gotta treat your customers well. They have no problem charging extra if you dont know the price, no problem cutting with fentanyl, no problem being late.. until you complain. One of the drivers is an asshole and treats me like im gonna rob him. The other one, i consider a friend. Always willing to help if I have a complaint or problem. Has replaced down i felt was sub par. Also helped him discover kratom and get off percocets. 

Lastly, I have a dealer who sells more party stuff, benzos, oxy... rich people crap lol. I trust this man completely. One of the most standup, caring men I have ever met. Takes harm reduction and such very seriously. Never rips people off, often gives me extras, always on time. I often spend a half hour just sitting talking with him about life and stuff. He's older than me and tries to mentor me which i really respect. I sell him subs some times and he rejected my price and paid more just because. 

There are great people in all walks of life. Good dealers make a difference in a users life whether they like it or not. I respect them and I always let the good one know they are appreciated. Lots of them struggle with addiction just like us, depression, anxiety, you name it. Its tough because we often see our dealers as enablers, which is true. This problem isnt going away tmrw and we need folks who care about users. not some jerk trying to make a quick buck. And that shines through here at least, the nicest dope men are the most popular."

Do you honestly think the average American would cry tears of joy and go mainline some H in a public bathroom when it becomes legal and regulated? Nah. Only addicts, who know they're getting something that won't kill them.

2016-05-29,notacareerserver,AskReddit,11,n/a,"This is so true. We knew my dad was going...KNEW. he had a matter of weeks left if that, after a 5 year battle with cancer. He was on Hospice, and if you're not aware, when someone is placed on hospice, you can't take them to the ER without revoking hospice care. If they make it through the hospital stay, you have to re-set everything back up.

We revoked my dads hospice care and took him in twice. Mainly because we were supposed to have the meds at home to keep him comfortable and out of pain (he had morphine, fentanyl patches, and Xanax). The last time we did it, we believe he may have had a stroke. Screaming in pain, I will never forget that sound ever. We couldn't stand it so called the ambulance. He had a DNR, and his heart never stopped but went into a medical term I can't remember and they used the defibrillator to get it back in rhythm. we all stood around and said our goodbyes and told him it was ok to go. 

He was a tough old dude and made it to the next day even though they said he wouldn't make it til noon the previous day. We got to bring him home (he even said, ""good"" when we told him lol) where he wanted to be. I'd have felt terrible if he'd died in the hospital vs at home where he wanted to go just because my mom and I weren't strong enough to watch him go like that. He was pretty much out of it that last week, but I did get him to say, ""I love you too baby"" a couple of times which will always mean the world to me. He passed peacefully in his sleep, in his hospital bed setup a few feet away from my parents' big bed my mom and I were asleep in. Took away some of the guilt I felt about calling 911 when he was a home hospice patient inches from death. I thank the heavens that he passed exactly where he'd have wanted to, with our little family all together, just the three of us and our dogs.

Woooo that got long, sorry! It's been a year and a few months but I still feel kind of guilty about interfering, even when in the end he went how he wanted."
2016-05-29,P51Mike1980,science,9,n/a,"Dilaudid is an opioid which can be used in PCAs, as well as Demerol, Morphine, and Fentanyl.  The hospital in which I did my med-surge rotation preferred Fentanyl.  Not sure about my current hospital as we don't deal with PCA's in the ER."
2016-05-29,foul_ol_ron,science,9,n/a,"Where I work, Fentanyl is used IV PCA far more often than morphine. Perhaps we use a shorter lockout time, and that accounts for the half life? "
2016-05-29,Fundus,science,6,n/a,"Fentanyl has a theoretical advantage where continuous infusions in PCAs (basal rates) are used, in that it is very short acting. Fentanyl has a half life of about 15 minutes, so in about an hour it's functionally gone. Morphine and hydromorphone have much longer half lives, closer to 2 hours, so it can take several hours to wash out of someone's system.

However, the steady state kinetics of fentanyl are different, i.e. fentanyl does not behave the same way in a continuous infusion as it does when given as a one-time dose. Fentanyl, when contiguously infused, has a variable half life up to 2-3 hours, such that it won't wear off as quickly. There's a lot of ICU literature now out there that suggests caution when using fentanyl infusions because of the longer than expected "
2016-05-30,jareths_tight_pants,science,18,n/a,I'm an ICU nurse. We use fentanyl drips all the time. Sometimes as a PCA too for patients with labile blood pressures. 
2016-05-30,ziggytrahloo,science,23,n/a,"In Australia, anyone with a PCA has hourly observations for the first 6 hours, going to 2 hourly obs after this time for the duration of the PCA. We have an acute pain service team who also reviews the patient daily whilst on PCA and part of this review is checking that observations have been done appropriately and whether the PCA is still indicated. We have a comprehensive reporting system for near misses and adverse events and this system is well utilised. 

We administer IV pain protocols in recovery prior to attaching PCA and PCA's usually consist of Fentanyl, Morphine or Oxycodone. We also occasionally run continuous Ketamine infusions for refractory pain or when opioids medications are contraindicated. Anyone in a high risk group such as those with multiple co-morbidities (central sleep apnoea, those receiving intrathecal morph) are usually monitored in a HDU area for ~24 hours. 

On the wards - if someone gets, for example, 5mg of Morphine sub cut, they are monitored for analgesic efficacy but regular observations are likely still 4 hourly unless otherwise indicated. 

It seems the article is saying that best practice guidelines and hospital policies are not being followed - likely to a lack of time and staffing levels. We have a 4:1 patient-nurse ratio on the wards enshrined in law - what's it like for everyone else?

Also, a batch of fentanyl-laced heroin was imported and distributed in my area. The FBI and DEA sent out warnings to all local law enforcement that overdoses would spike as a result. So the county thought the classes were a necessity.

What actually happened was that addicts attended the classes, they all shot up with the fentanyl-laced heroin and they had a ""spotter"" standing by with narcan to revive any that overdosed. It basically had the opposite intended effect. *More* addicts were overdosing because they had a false sense of confidence after having the narcan training. Addicts weren't as afraid of dying after consuming the fentanyl-laced heroin, because they thought narcan would save them.

A number of my gear had Red Cross/Red Crecents on it. I was told that I would be treated fairly if captured due to my 'non-combatant status'. Our initial training seemed to continue this notion of the medic being immune to combat, able to run accross the battlefield tending wounded without any regard for injury. Truthfully, we felt like guardian angels. But war is hell.

Every mission/unit is different a little bit; but, to be quite frank, when a platoon of mounted soldiers rides out into a known enemy stronghold expecting a fight, they only take their most experienced guys when we dismount (and a medic). More than half the platoon stays with the vehicles, even though they are all 'combat-arms'. For my time in the Scout Platoon, I was treated as I should have been, a technical expert that they hoped they never needed to use. 

I have been the 4th man on an entry team. I have conducted a 'hard-landing' on a rooftop of an afghani goverment building out of a blackhawk. I have helped 'clean-up' after a special operations detatchment cleans out a compound. I've experienced a couple massive explosions, and numerous minor ones. I've climbed a litteral mountain with a small kill team. I have treated catastrophic casualties and twisted ankles. I was the sole medical provider for 45 soldiers for virtually the entire deployment, with phone calls to the PA back at the aid station for my only support besides evacuation. I even got to cut off a man's foot as I shadowed a forward-surgical team. It was exceedingly varied as the deployment progressed. I was a gunner for 4 days when ours took shrapnel. I had to throw grenades in combat. I have had to defend myself or my platoon in heavily armed combat. Ive sent three Americans on a Medivac, and about a dozen afghanis. But mostly I sat around playing video games, watchiing movies, or talking about 'bitches',

Equipment wise, I carried an Colt M4, Berretta 92, a smoke grenade, 210 rounds of 5.56 AP & 30 rounds of 9mm ball ammunition. I had an used ACH and a KDH plate carrier with front, back, and side 7.62 rated ceramic plates. Kneepads, eyepro, flashhproof uniform/gloves, a Camelback, a individual firstaid kit, an extra two tourniquets and a chest-rig for medic supplies. I carried an M9 Aid bag with a folded mesh litter. The heaviest I ever wighed before an air insert was 405 lbs when I normally weighed 215 (but a lot of that was extra water). I rocked either Danner Gila boots or the standard issue Belvilles. Everything but the aidbag and weapon was Multi-Cam pattern. 

The downside about being the medic, even in a war where we didnt wear any identifying markings, was that it was still obvious. The guy with the biggest backpack on was the one to shoot at first, or was the 'mark' when waiting to command detonate a IED. 

Training wise, I was certified in the United States as a ""EMT-Basic"" (drive the ambulance and carry the bags). Our scope of practice was far higher than that however. We were trained by PA's and Docs for advanced hemorrage techniques, advanced airways (RSI, King LT/Combi-tube, cricothyrotomy, NPA/OPA), breathing (chest tube, NCD, chest seals, rescue breathing, and even hyperbaric decompression), circulatory (Fast1, IV/Hextend kits, hypothermia kit, pressure infuser).  Other assesment equipment included Cardiac 3 stethoscope, pulse ox, glucometer, good headlamp, extra penlight, tons of sharpies, a stapler & roll of gorrilla tape, couple SAM splints, thermometers, small suction device, a plethora of trauma sheers, and some pogey bait. A medbox had a lot of different varying meds, but usually included Morphine auto-injectors, Narcan, toradol, valium, tylenol 3's, Fentanyl pops, EPI-Pen, Benadryl, phenergan, zofran, invanz, immodium, and nitro. A seperate box had all my RSI drugs & a handful of combat pill packs (Meloxicam, Tylenol, Moxifloxacin). Then I kept a couple small bottles to give to the afghanis of either Tylenol or Motrin.

I had a big restock bag in the truck (S.T.O.M.P. II). Also, a traction splint, a spineboard, extra litter, a SKEDCO sled. A sickcall bag that had a otoscope\ophthalmoscope, couple minor wound kits, a bunch of excess pills, extra scaples, extra other shit. On top of all the kits and bags were tons of extra Kerlix, combat guaze, isreali bandages, tourniquets, trauma sheers, and other shit im sure i'm forgetting.

Our packing lists all had to meet the minimum of ""The Ranger Medic Handbook"", but we could carry other shit like the ranger ratchets, SOF-T tourniquets, and special litters. Check out the free 2007 version

If combined with an upper (speedball) or a benzodizepine, or just on its own in too large of a dose, it can be incredibly dangerous and its dangerous reputation is well deserved.

2016-06-01,[deleted],morbidquestions,6,n/a,"Heroin bought on the street ranges in purity, depending on how many times it's been stepped on. Average purity has gone up in recent years, but still ranges from anywhere between 10-15% pure. With no tolerance whatsoever, 3 typical 'stamps' would more than likely be enough to kill someone, injected intravenously. A stamp is a wax paper bag about the size of a postage stamp that typically contains about .1grams of heroin. An every day IV heroin user could safely inject upwards of 5 stamps several times daily, with no ill effects. Cases of regular users overdosing sometimes stem from heroin cut with fentanyl (a synthetic opiate active in micrograms). Safe bet would be to buy a bundle (anywhere from 10-13 bags of .1grams of heroin, depending on the dealer), mix it all and inject it in one go. Unless it was absolutely bunk shit, it would be tough for even a junkie to survive that. 

Source: I used to be addicted to heroin. 

Edited to add: As far as one knowing what would be lethal; in my experience, while I had the option to purchase heroin from several different sets (crews, gangs, whatever) in a given area, there was almost always someone around who knew where to go for the best dope on the street. Different sets would develop a reputation for higher grade dope, and would stamp their brand name on the bags. Typically, the ones that evoked imagery of death (ie; 187, Bobblehead, Icebox, DOA, etc) would be a safe bet as far as purity. "

- Mutliple people close to Prince have come out and stated on the record that in his last few weeks of life, Prince had become very paranoid, thinking that someone was out to get him.
- Princes last Instagram posts was a picture of himself with the caption ""Just When U Thought U Were Safe...."" Which many have taken to mean just as he finalized the deal/ended the legal battle and thought he was safe, he had reason to believe someone meant to do him harm over the outcome of the lawsuit.

2016-06-02,JuiceBusters,Music,9,n/a,"Apparently this 'Fentanyl' has led to some deaths in my home province. Sound like its a strong opioid. 

So, while everyone wants to say 'damn doctors.. handing out like candy.. lets make it so doctors stop giving it so easily..'.

Often doctors are prescribing these for beautiful humane and all the right reasons. Because some people were in brutal accidents or they've just come out of absolutely brutal surgery and will be in horrific insanely horrific pain for days and weeks. Or people are living longer and at age 80 grandmothers are kept alive despite absolutely insanely painful levels of osteo and 10 other extremely painful conditions. It's going to help returning soldiers who are going to have to live in extreme long-term daily pain but are still young and trying to raise families and work for a living. 

That their 22 year old drug-lovin nephew keeps stealing them from the medicine cabinet isn't on doctor's prescriptions. It's on the 22 year old drug kid who's writing a blog about how drugs need to be totally legalized because its the government that *made him* have to steal from his grandmother. 

Or then its staff at seniors homes who are collecting left-overs. I mean either the patients forget to take them or they literally die and the nefarious staffer finds a bottle leftover and so on. 

and then I'm told clever bad guys, jungle-chemists and renegade Chem students can make this (I've never seen that side but there it is). For that matter, lots can be coming from what are otherwise totally legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers overseas via smuggler bad dudes. 

And finally. who are you blaming if Prince (for the sake of argument) suffered a nasty painful injury or came out of a brutal surgery and was prescribed a correct amount. Clearly stating 1 tablet once a day for 5 days maximum and NOT to be mixed with any other drugs etc?

Prince or anyone else decides to defy the prescription and takes 3. Then decides to have a glass or five of wine. Then decides this would be great topped off with a benzo and a half a sleeping pill and dies. 

Drive your car 190 km through a red light and don't blame the DMV or Chrysler for 'handing out cars like candy'. Did you eat at KFC 5 times a day at 5X the calories and daily fat intake recommended and you are going to die from this? Don't blame KFC for 'handin out chicken like its candy'. Dying from Diabetes because the corner store is handing out damn candy like its candy.

The brother may be charged and then whoever supplied it will likely be investigated, as well, because Fentanyl is only supplied when Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, and Morphine are no longer doing the trick. It's so powerful that it is usually administered through a patch, so that it's very slowly absorbed through the skin. This is the stuff that's been killing heroin addicts in Chicago for the past 12-13 years. The powder version that Chicago heroin is sometimes cut with is made illicitly in Mexico, because no legitimate drug company would make something so powerful into a pill. An amount that is half the size of a match head will kill a hardcore heroin addict; someone who can eat oxy like candy and not even get high because of their tolerance.

2016-06-02,incandesantlite,Music,836,n/a,"Fentanyl is like 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. It may have been a total accident though. Prince was very. very skinny and Fentanyl patches get absorbed into your body fat and then the drug is slowly released over time into your bloodstream. People (especially geriatric patients) with low body fat have to be very careful with Fentanyl because too much of the drug can be released at one time and can cause an overdose. Fentanyl is only prescribed to patients that are already dependent on opiates and have very severe pain (i.e. cancer patients, AID's patients etc). Usually it comes in patch form and you leave the patch on for 72 hours. When I was an opiate addict I used to get fentanyl patches from a family member and I would cut them up and chew on them releasing all of the drug at once into my body. This is extremely dangerous and I probably should be dead because of the amount of opiates I would consume all at once. One mother's day I chewed 1/2 fentanyl patch then snorted an oxycodone 80mg. I am really lucky to be alive and in recovery. I'll have one year sober from opiates on 6/26 of this year. Thank god for Suboxone! 


Edit: Fixed mistake pointed out by GreasyPeanut. Fentanyl is 50x stronger than heroin and 100x stronger than morphine.

I wonder where does your information comes from?

Fentanyl is a prescription drug that only recently has garnered media and public recognition. My daughter was on the patches for several years for a debilitatively painful condition that other medications could not help. Once the medical problem was finally treated somewhat successfully, she was heavily addicted. Her doctors knew this, too. It took 3 years of suffering while working with specialists to become drug free. 

Unlike other opioids you cannot stop fentanyl ""cold turkey,"" as it can kill you. She had to undergo medically supervised trading of addictions, over time, right down to suboxone therapy, often used for heroin addicts. (Fentanyl is far worse than herion, by the way.) Now she is drug free.

One of the after effects of serious fentanyl addiction is that even once you become drug free, you may still experience various side effects for years, possibly for life.

My daughter always said she could have made a fortune on the black market, because of how much it sold for. From the pharmacy, a month supply of patches was a $10 copay."
2016-06-02,PopWhatMagnitude,Music,125,n/a,"Exactly, **he died from Chronic Pain.** 

Unfortunately the best method of treatment for that is still opiates (In many cases). Even worse is many people who suffer similarly are only given access to opiates with Acetaminophen so that just adds to the damage being done.

People need to go lurk /r/ChronicPain before picking up their pitchforks to go after opiates and learn how to be empathic before spewing their uninformed opinions on opiates. 

Your neighbors cousin ODing from heroin because he shot up a Fentanyl tainted dose should have absolutely nothing to do with a 78 year old Grandma taking a prescribed Norco before bed to dull her hip pain."
